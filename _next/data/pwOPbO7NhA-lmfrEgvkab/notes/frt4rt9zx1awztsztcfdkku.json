So, for example, there's a team whose color is Gold, whose segment of society is ‚ÄúThe Establishment‚Äù, meaning specifically the US Government. The rest of the world is another, I think, two teams.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dhappy.github.io/13-13s/\">https://dhappy.github.io/13-13s/</a></p>\n<p>There are 13 Captains. The President would be one. I get to be one. I have one buddy who's been through this with me for years that I told could Captain.</p>\n<p>I want Ryan Renolds for Mint Mobile. I want to use mobile cell towers to provide network coverage to war areas and create the logistical support necessary for every combatant to have a live-streaming minder recording everything they do in the conflict.</p>\n<p>My assumption is that people won't be capable of the brutality necessary for war if they know that everyone on the planet will have near instant access to the knowledge that they personally did whatever.</p>\n<p>The short game is about creating a piece of software to composite 13 completely unique wraps for 13 Cybertrucks modified to support someone living out of it: ‚ÄúMuskshacks‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I want to put light bars on the 13 wrapped Cybertrucks.</p>\n<p>The deal I want to propose is there's an auction. I get them for the first year then they go to the winner of the auction.</p>\n<p>I'll record a video of my fleet of Cybertrucks sealing off the exits from nearby law enforcement establishments. I tell them that if I, or anyone operating under the protection of the Resistance, are arrested, we will seal you in wherever you take us.</p>\n<p>Some shots of these things screeching up with that electric acceleration and closing a place off in under 90 seconds would, I think, be impressive.</p>\n<p>I'd publish the video to the public and let everyone know that this was the advertised response, so the cops can't complain too heartily that it's been done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I want something to fire a pilons into the ground securing the truck in place.</p>\n<p>Part of the deep cut for this one is that certain parts of this are kept secret and released in conjunction with the Presidential Inaugurations which happen to align with the beginning of Capricorn on the 13-sign scientifically accurate Zodiac.</p>\n<p>So, these trucks, or even better, something disguised as a PoS, would park near residential areas, anchor itself to the ground, and use powerful speakers to create a minor seismic event.</p>\n<p>Also, if they're acting as a blockade the pilons could be difficult to force apart from the truck, but very easily detached by an operator. So you roll up &#x26; stick. It'll be difficult to unstick you without your cooperation.</p>\n<p>So the cops will just stop arresting people rather than deal with the hassle. What do you think they'd do?</p>\n<p>In reality, I hope to use the roll up and stick method for controlling access to a location before it's at the police station. I want to throw parties with lots of sex and quality drugs at the end of a single road with several choke points planned if law enforcement were to show up.</p>\n<p>Because I want to live-stream the historical process that is The Revolution. Every day we make some progress and that is shared with anyone interested instantaneously.</p>\n<p>So, much of the debauchery would be very public.</p>\n<p>But this is when I've got my threat of The Resistance's truck fleet. We'll tell the police that we're not going to do anything hurtful &#x26; they best just leave us alone.</p>\n<p>People can have NFC cards that prove that a specific physical chip is being read. So long as you keep control of your card, you can prove you're you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/Cybertruck%20wraps.jpg\" alt=\"Cybertruck wraps\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/hydkpabz319dsx1aalftjtu\">2022‚Äì2023/09/21ùÑà Dept. of Happiness' Server</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","desc":"","updated":1695693912066,"created":1694056545245,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","body":"\n_TRWBL_ is a near-term science fiction story describing the progression from the world of today to a future without homelessness, hunger, or war.\n\nIf such a narrative could be made sufficiently convincing, people might be convinced to participate in the initial steps outlined for bringing the plan to fruition.\n\nThe main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[Yggdrasil|13-13s]].\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nConceptually, _TRWBL_ is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.\n\nThje desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particualrly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAn organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"aaf678b782264ed02915d893cbcc6922","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":84,"offset":397},"end":{"line":6,"column":104,"offset":417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":7,"offset":1367},"end":{"line":22,"column":57,"offset":1417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":46,"offset":1985},"end":{"line":25,"column":81,"offset":2020},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"^code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":16,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":22,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","dr794to5a3oswlo3dpjc8kv","877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r","sg2kjz4k4yrraezod6su58n","ybps4r8zc7a3wo185esfhi6","mmb0b8gqm9nh7uwsh6q7xhd","tofl5r7jed0qihgmrny3vjs"],"parent":null,"data":{}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
