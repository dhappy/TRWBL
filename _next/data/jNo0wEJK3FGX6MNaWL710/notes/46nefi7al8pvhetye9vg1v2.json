It's a constantly shifting set, but currently:\n➀ Courier: Tells the blind delivery service where to pick up &#x26; drop off stuff. If the courier is stopped, it connects to legal representation that intercedes between you &#x26; the police.\n➁ Fight: Evaluations of recordings of battles used to determine genuine physical threatningness for use in rules enforcement.\n➂ Rules: There is a massive map of the world with 3D representations allowing the precise rental of all spaces. The renter of each will determine the ruleset for that area. Worst case scenario is generally expulsion from an area &#x26; in that case force may be applied, thus the need for dangerous people.\n➃ Mïmis: A \"filesystem\" in a graph database with easy interfaces for creating new subgraphs. Contains all information regardless of copywrite claim. Chunks of the graph are fed to various AIs.\n➄ Lease: Conveys the ability to stay in occupied spaces. Also to coordinate the occupation of spaces. Leases in different areas will not be available to all the teams at all times. There is a pattern to the alternation of Red Alliance, Purple Alliance, Blue Alliance, Purple Alliance, Red Alliance, etc.\n➅ The Veilid Network: An anonymizing layer created mobile-first. It creates a virtual overlay network within which information is routed without knowledge of the underlying (TC/UD)P/IP-based internet. It allows us to have Mïmis propagate itself including copyrighted information.</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/a3wx4f4ohmne8lcka59gkdu\">Courier Service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/btzu3ymifbepie8aqx16gaq\">Duos</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/y13gk0lor7b85r292uy05od\">Existing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/i2efue9tpvo904olulmykjp\">Mob</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/pjtt8hsvupum7f1ophumcu1\">Ship</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/xm29iqioujinpyer0okhr8h\">Spaces</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/25o1thima7xhdngin9ogusd\">Stay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/2gc6e09zgfaqf4bpe2c6l0x\">Stuff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/950aqp7aas21glbho4mlvxj\">The New Black Market</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/\">The Revolution Will Be Live</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/46nefi7al8pvhetye9vg1v2\">Projects</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","desc":"","updated":1718781237944,"created":1694056545245,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","body":"\n_TRWBL_ operates under the assumption at some point in the future homelessness and hunger will be eliminated for at least a whole day.\n\nIt's an attainable goal physically. We have enough shelter and food for everyone to have a share. The real issue would be the logistics. Tracking all the people and tracking where they eat and lodge.\n\nIt'd be alot better if it were a program coming not from the establishment. I want to try and sell black people on a plan for non-violent revolution beginning as a \"black\" club that one only gains membership to by being judged as \"black\" by the existing membership.\n\nOne could have their Black card revoked as social censure. Each team aims to satisfy one of thirteen basic needs. Black people's is drugs. They evolve a market with testing facilities between the production and distribution through blind couriers which doesn't rely on violence to mediate issues.\n\nWe aim to create a rat park where everything's available, but the populace is content enough that they don't abuse.\n\nThe main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[Yggdrasil|13-13s]] of which the Black team is one.\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nConceptually, _TRWBL_ is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.\n\nThe desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particularly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAn organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"496c7b83c5572fbafa8c883607096c15","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":84,"offset":1103},"end":{"line":12,"column":104,"offset":1123},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":7,"offset":2103},"end":{"line":28,"column":57,"offset":2153},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":31,"column":46,"offset":2721},"end":{"line":31,"column":81,"offset":2756},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"^code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":20,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":26,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":32,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","dr794to5a3oswlo3dpjc8kv","d3sothjfci29ellfj1qyhxv","l7d2hpmu312r01lzm1gnnp0","rneltt7vje4p0zhbba4c3gw","5u2zfeltksurw3dugmjlm1k","tlc1or8xitw5etbr3nkhhe4"],"parent":null,"data":{}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
