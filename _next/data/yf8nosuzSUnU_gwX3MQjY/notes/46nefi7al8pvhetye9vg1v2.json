Aimed in large part at the violence, dilution, &#x26; theft-free distribution of substances, be they pharmacetical or psychotropic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Courier:</strong> Rather than most substances being delivered through the mail, there could be a person-to-person blind delivery service. Couriers are pairs of people in a vehicle. They serve a variety of tasks dependent on the need:</p>\n<p>This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dashcam:</strong> An Android app for recording driving with an active operator to be called in times of emergency. The same application is used when a pair is called on as camerapeople. One of the main rule enforcement mechanisms is to send camerapeople to investigate disturbances.\nThe streams are shared with anyone present in them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dispatch:</strong> Cars are generally two people and they can serve a variety of functions. As Driver &#x26; <a href=\"#courier\">Courier</a> delivering a parcel. As Driver and <a href=\"#stuff\">Clerk</a> pandering to a rider in the car. The dispatch application helps the pairs coordinate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alignments:</strong> Allow the 13 teams of Yggdrasil to coordinate with each other to allocate the 13 axes. Each teams starts by specifying their optimal layout. This program would also contain other aspects of team coordination such as the various bonding curves for token swapping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Code:</strong> There are 13 projects. Participants may be members of multiple teams to varying extents. Development is through a series of pair programming meetings where the developers pass off control of the codebase from one pair to another. Peers review the process and based on their evaluations reputations are formed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mïmis:</strong> A distributed graph database of versioned XML documents holding, initially, bunches of variations of SVGs and unzipped EPub books. In addition to the traditional file tree, other contexts will be available for reference; such as recolorings of SVGs or collections of icons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reader:</strong> A web-based eReader meant to allow browsing the universal library stored in <a href=\"#m%C3%AFmis\">Mïmis</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Stuff:</strong> What does the world hold and where is it located.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> 13-Sign Zodiac / Hijri / 10-hour day w/ 100 minutes per hour / 100 seconds per minute; coordinated with the housing arrangements from <a href=\"#stay\">Stay</a> &#x26; devs from <a href=\"#code\">Code</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ring:</strong> Part of rules enforcement relies on the credible threat of physical force.

Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"bb83a623cffb263d0ac797138aadd776","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":84,"offset":397},"end":{"line":6,"column":104,"offset":417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":7,"offset":1357},"end":{"line":22,"column":57,"offset":1407},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":46,"offset":1975},"end":{"line":25,"column":80,"offset":2009},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":14,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":20,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":26,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r","otfp9itf9ycjy3lf3312gq2","miefx31q2sgnvrka0v040g7","yifbw4yupdr2w4qe4qdh6j2"],"parent":null,"data":{}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
