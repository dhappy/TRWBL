Each node in the tree is a separate updatable document. The entire structure is cached in a Neo4j instance running in Docker either on the user's machine or in the cloud.</p>\n<p>The output for any path is available as both content and context. The context for a location is produced using any of a variety of algorithms provided by Neo4j. They can run a local page rank that is tracking their browsing history with much finer granularity than Google ever could b/c it is a trusted agent.</p>\n<h1 id=\"product\">Product<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#product\"></a></h1>\n<p>What I can get done is highly dependent on the money. I have an increasingly complete vision for how a group of software systems could interact. <a href=\"https://github.com/MetaFam/mimis/\">Mïmis</a> is the base of it all.</p>\n<p>Mïmis houses and organizes all the data. As peers are consuming data, they are also sharing their cache of the source forest. Those source trees can be public or private.</p>\n<p>In addition to Ceramic, I would like users to be able to store a set of nodes locally. These nodes are also used to generate interfaces and manage the cache, but it is not public that the user is hosting them.</p>\n<p>Software-wise, there is the client, and Ceramic is really the \"server\". All the logic for how to expand the source tree to the render tree is local.</p>\n<h1 id=\"progress\">Progress<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#progress\"></a></h1>\n<p>On the larger front, I can only really focus in depth on one project at a time. I first became convinced I could be an active part of a rapid societal change over a decade ago. I've contemplated hundreds of different use cases for apps in that period, but I really only have the time to reason thoroughly through five or six.</p>\n<p>My stretch goal is the end of war, so what percentage of that do I have figured out? 65‒70%. There are three independent striations – the personal, the social, and the planetary – that this change will take place in, and I think I have a reasonably well grounded plan for each.</p>\n<h1 id=\"differentiation\">Differentiation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#differentiation\"></a></h1>\n<p>No one else is doing this because it tramples over copyright laws, massively simplifies building a child pornography collection, and is great for doxing someone.</p>\n<p>As for the Revolution, white people don't think it can happen, and black people don't think it can be done peacefully.</p>\n<h1 id=\"team\">Team<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#team\"></a></h1>\n<p>I, Will Holcomb, \"δυς\", will take anything you give me up to $10k, match it, and focus on finding competent pair programming partners.

Git.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MC@$10k + Δυς@$10k + ETH@$10k = $30k would allow the addition of private source graph storage, a content recommendation engine based on combining forests, and tools for revising the contents of points.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MC@$10k + Δυς@$10k + ETH@$10k + MG@$10k + TREE@$10k = $50k, and we add the dashcam app. Part of what Mïmis will do is propagate DIDs for everyone. This digital identity can be leveraged to coordinate the movement of agents in the real world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$100k and I can build a Warehouse ala. Warhol where talented developers push out finished versions of my half-formed creations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Project development takes place in terms of sprints aligned to the lunar cycle. Team leads have rotating stays at various luxurious locations in conjunction with other leads. Meetings from these locations are all livestreamed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$100k + mass-spectroscopy equipment, and it's full-steam ahead. We open a testing facility for drug supplies that serves as the basis for a reformed (violence, theft, and impurity-free) black market.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$100k + mass-spectroscopy equipment + an aircraft carrier, uh-oh, this is breaking too fast. Too many people are having unpleasant awakenings to the concept that Jesus or Mohammed is just another historical figure and looking for someone to blame. Bullets are cheap, and crazies aplenty. Time to hit the open seas and become unassassinable for a few years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"help\">Help<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#help\"></a></h1>\n<p>How I would like to see this executed is via recorded pair programming.

Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
