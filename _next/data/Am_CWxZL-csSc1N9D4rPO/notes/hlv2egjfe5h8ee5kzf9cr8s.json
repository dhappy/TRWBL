The courier transports a locked sealed parcel where the code is transmitted directly between buyer &#x26; seller. Payment is direct and potentially escrowed.</p>\n<p>It expands to delivery of parcels between rooms and eventually expands into the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals\">Goals<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#goals\"></a></h2>\n<p>The overarching goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide reputations via attestations</li>\n<li>allow perusing items for sale</li>\n<li>arrange for delivery of purchases</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"attestations\">Attestations<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#attestations\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are a variety of potential attestations, but perhaps the most important is the probability someone is a part of law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Also, attestations are used to build seller profiles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#security\"></a></h2>\n<p>One of the options for security is to token gate everything. The question there is how large of a group could be mustered and be reasonably certain law enforcement wasn't holding? The answer is too small a group to be useful.</p>\n<p>An alternative is attestations which are collected by a protected server. The server would then gate access to the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"retaliation\">Retaliation<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#retaliation\"></a></h2>\n<p>Outside access is limited as much as possible, but in the case of an arrest for a crime committed on the part of the organization, a mob of people would descend upon the police station and prevent vehicular access with their bodies.</p>\n<p>Doing this in a metropolitan area makes the situation different. In a rural location it's not infeasible that we could gather enough people they literally don't have room to arrest us all. In an urban setting, there are tens of thousands of potential cells which changes the math.</p>\n<p>It should still be possible to muster enough people that for publicity reasons they can't all be arrested, but it's not as nice a safeguard as it being literally impossible.</p>\n<p>Ideally though a response could be mobilized quickly enough that the confrontation happens at the initial point of contact before the arresting officers make it back to base.</p>\n<p>At the least, vehicles could be used to restrict access while people gather.</p>\n<p>There <em>could</em> be gatherings of people willing to obstruct traffic spaced throughout the operational area. Partying in safe locations unless a need for obstruction arises: “block” parties so to speak.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","desc":"","updated":1695693912066,"created":1694056545245,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"aaf678b782264ed02915d893cbcc6922","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":84,"offset":397},"end":{"line":6,"column":104,"offset":417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":7,"offset":1367},"end":{"line":22,"column":57,"offset":1417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":46,"offset":1985},"end":{"line":25,"column":81,"offset":2020},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"^code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":14,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":20,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":26,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","dr794to5a3oswlo3dpjc8kv","877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r","d3u5mnacjj26jxf6dp8ay27","j0ecyp4wkm6o7w1gioq8uyb","woe3og3mgi4blm9dhhw09xy","kcmbuc52veizf61pdhsspcv"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n_TRWBL_ is a near-term science fiction story describing the progression from the world of today to a future without homelessness, hunger, or war.\n\nIf such a narrative could be made sufficiently convincing, people might be convinced to participate in the initial steps outlined for bringing the plan to fruition.\n\nThe main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[Yggdrasil|13-13s]].\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nConceptually, _TRWBL_ is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.\n\nThje desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particualrly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAn organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
