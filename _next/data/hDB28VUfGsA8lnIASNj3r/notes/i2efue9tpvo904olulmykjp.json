Participants receive a base payment for being present for a session and recording a video. That compensation, however, can be more than doubled based on peer review of the session stream.</p>\n<p>The goal is to provide a resource for architects who have a reasonably well structured project description, but don't have the resources to build a development organization. Also, the recordings will capture the entire development process for the program, and, when combined with the review metadata should provide interested parties a live \"blame\" view of the author's thinking for each piece of code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"interfaces\">Interfaces<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#interfaces\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are four primary interfaces used to orchestrate the endeavor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#scheduling\">Scheduling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#transition\">Transition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#execution\">Execution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#review\">Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"scheduling\">Scheduling<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#scheduling\"></a></h3>\n<p>A session has at least three participants: the Navigator, the Driver, and a Witness. The Navigator described the code to be written while the Driver operates the keyboard.</p>\n<p>Navigators apply for sessions by providing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a minimum hourly rate they will accept</li>\n<li>the time slot they desire; because the time is dependant on the session before, they specify what they want as:\n<ul>\n<li>a minimum start time</li>\n<li>a maximum end time</li>\n<li>a minimum duration</li>\n<li>a preferred duration</li>\n<li>a maximum duration</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a set of GitHub issues they intend to address</li>\n<li>a set of tasks they expect to accomplish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Members of a planning circle maintain a GitHub project to rank issues and tasks so that would be Navigators know what to prioritize.</p>\n<h4 id=\"scheduling-incentives\">Scheduling Incentives<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#scheduling-incentives\"></a></h4>\n<p>The expected minimum pay is $15 / hour for everyone with bonuses based on the result of the evaluation of the recording.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transition\">Transition<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#transition\"></a></h3>\n<p>The basic process is a repetition of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mob Working</li>\n<li>Mob Coordinating</li>\n<li>Mob Transitioning</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where “Mob Transitioning” is a change of Navigator. For any given mob, there is a <em>“Navigator”</em>. The Navigator runs the call &#x26; is the ultimate authority when it comes to the direction of the mob. Depending on the relative skillsets, the Navigator may be dictating the majority of the code.</p>\n<p>The mechanics of operating the machinery of the computer falls to the <em>“Driver”</em>. Under the instruction of the rest of the mob they manage files and their contents, and run whatever tests are desired.</p>\n<p>There's at least three people in a mob, and the <em>“Witness”</em> rounds out the basic three. The Witness has <a href=\"https://pairs.trwb.live\">software they use to evaluate the call</a>.</p>\n<p>Any of the three positions in the mob can swap out…</p>\n<p>During the hour of overlap the incoming pair will get a stream key for the Driver to configure OBS on their system. The viewing key will be encrypted using Lit &#x26; made accessible to appropriate token and address holders.</p>\n<p>All participants in the call are encouraged to record in case there's some issue with the Driver's stream.</p>\n<p>Calls take place via a Discord video chat that has a bot bouncer limiting access to holders of specific addresses and tokens.</p>\n<p>The two pairs use the overlapping hour for the departing team to summarize their accomplishments &#x26; any outstanding tasks. Based on this feedback the coming pair may choose to alter the tasks they play to address.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the leaving pair makes a final commit and control passes to the new team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"execution\">Execution<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#execution\"></a></h3>\n<p>A major component of compensation is based on input from a program that semantically breaks down the video into time periods of activities like debugging or new development or testing.</p>\n<p>Periods when the pair goes off track are marked as well as events like discovering a solution and writing code that doesn't conform to the syntax standards.</p>\n<p>During their session the participants have access to this review interface to create a first pass at marking the recording in real time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"review\">Review<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#review\"></a></h3>\n<p>One of the dangers of this system is that the development pair will accidentally reveal secret information to the stream that will be used by an attacker to perform an exploit.</p>\n<p>To avoid this, until the video has undergone a set of trusted full reviews where the interface allows the flagging for blurring of secret data review will be limited to sets of token holders.</p>\n<p>As well as an objective description of the events, reviewers are also able to make subjective assessments: both descriptive statements and also weighted terms. It will also be possible to review reviews and rate the veracity of an assessment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"incentives\">Incentives<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#incentives\"></a></h4>\n<p>The pair of programmers receive a fixed rate that is moderated by the reviews of their session.</p>\n<p>The initial three reviewers will earn at the same rate as the other participants. In general the idea is we are buying people's time and that is worth roughly the same amount <em>(~$15⁄hr)</em> regardless of whose time it is.</p>\n<p>After the initial reviews, compensation will be for establishing consensus on the evaluation of the video. Adding annotations that weren't present previously &#x26; are voted meaningful by a quorum of voters will be rewarded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technologies\">Technologies<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#technologies\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://livepeer.org\">Livepeer</a> will be used for steaming the sessions &#x26; capturing recordings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ceramic.network\">Ceramic</a> will be used for storing review information.</li>\n<li>The FVM will be used for token-based accomplishment tracking and permissions using <a href=\"https://hypercerts.org\">Hypercerts</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ipfs.io\">IPFS</a> will be used for the storage of video streams.</li>\n<li>Postgresql will be used for querying bids to determine potential schedules.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/46nefi7al8pvhetye9vg1v2\">Projects</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","desc":"","updated":1718781237944,"created":1694056545245,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","body":"\n_TRWBL_ operates under the assumption at some point in the future homelessness and hunger will be eliminated for at least a whole day.\n\nIt's an attainable goal physically. We have enough shelter and food for everyone to have a share. The real issue would be the logistics. Tracking all the people and tracking where they eat and lodge.\n\nIt'd be alot better if it were a program coming not from the establishment. I want to try and sell black people on a plan for non-violent revolution beginning as a \"black\" club that one only gains membership to by being judged as \"black\" by the existing membership.\n\nOne could have their Black card revoked as social censure. Each team aims to satisfy one of thirteen basic needs. Black people's is drugs. They evolve a market with testing facilities between the production and distribution through blind couriers which doesn't rely on violence to mediate issues.\n\nWe aim to create a rat park where everything's available, but the populace is content enough that they don't abuse.\n\nThe main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[Yggdrasil|13-13s]] of which the Black team is one.\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nConceptually, _TRWBL_ is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.\n\nThe desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particularly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAn organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"496c7b83c5572fbafa8c883607096c15","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":84,"offset":1103},"end":{"line":12,"column":104,"offset":1123},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":7,"offset":2103},"end":{"line":28,"column":57,"offset":2153},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":31,"column":46,"offset":2721},"end":{"line":31,"column":81,"offset":2756},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"^code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":22,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":34,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","dr794to5a3oswlo3dpjc8kv","e2h7ri7db7m60baeaeeubg9","app5iaj9jxz30w8jqmeld8z","n9ole85o0jufbqt4bbcyt2u","6yc4snnmcteact1lpek0suk","23smumztadzckc8yaiplvr1"],"parent":null,"data":{}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
