* Projects
  * **Stay:** Mapping spaces, capturing task descriptions, and coordinating property management, allowing participants to maintain and reserve spaces at a minimum of monetary cost.
  Space is rented by a user under the auspices of a set of teams. The team specifies the expected application of the space.
  * **Substances:** An interface for selling things with a digital testing certificate. Aimed in large part at the violence, dilution, & theft-free distribution of substances, be they pharmaceticals or psychotropic.
  * **Courier:** Rather than most substances being delivered through the mail, there could be a person-to-person blind delivery service. Couriers are pairs of people in a vehicle.
  This includes:
    * **Dashcam:** An Android app for recording driving with an active operator to be called in times of emergency of police interference.
  * **Dispatch:**  Cars are generally two people and they can serve a variety of functions. As Driver & [Courier](#courier) delivering a parcel. As Driver and [Clerk](#stuff) pandering to a rider in the car. The goal is to leverage existing organizations – local militia groups, indigenous tribes, and autonymous individuals and organizations.
  * **Alignments:** Allow the 13 teams of Yggdrasil to coordinate with each other to allocate the 13 axes. Each teams starts by specifying their optimal layout.
  * **Code:** The 13 teams each spearhead a project. Participants may be members of multiple teams to varying extents. Each team has a development group for each of the 13 projects. (Albeit perhaps of size zero.) These dev groups meet in spaces coordinated by [Stay](#stay). [Code](#code) captures livestreamed pair programming sessions saved using [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org).
  * **Argus:** Currently a ruby app loads data into Neo4j. I'm strongly considering switching to javascript, but the program will load data from a relational source of CSV into Neo4j. Then, it will serialize those graph relationships into JSON-Linked Data. Those it will publish as a doubly-linked list to IDX.
  * **Mïmis:** A stream of JSON-LD documents alter the state of a Neo4j graph. Users navigate the resultant structure.
  * **Yggdrasil:** There needs to be some interface for specifying aspects of how teams are configured; at a minimum the token swap curves & category to team mappings.
  * **Reader:** A web-based eReader which contains exploded ePubs and PDFs.
  * **Stuff:** What does the world hold and where is it located.
  * **Schedule:** 13-Sign Zodiac / Hijri / 10+10 light & dark / 100 minutes per hour / 100 seconds per minute; coordinated with the housing arrangements from [Stay](#stay) & devs from [Code](#code).

The last five are based on the concept of an open conspiracy using ostensible characteristics. Like Proof of Humanity has you record a video to prove you're human, I want a Proof of Blackness site – true "fuck the police" blackness.

There are 13 tokens and 13 essential needs. The token is supposed to exchange very favorably for its associated need. Food, for instance, is really cheap in orange tokens, and shelter in brown.

Two of the needs, Substances and Sex, put the game at potential odds with law enforcement. The other teams, of which the existing establishment is one, coordinate to help back credible retaliatory threats.
