# TRWBL: The Revolution Will Be Live

At its heart, TRWBL is a near-term science-fiction story describing the transition from extant human history to a society without homelessness or hunger.

There's lots of self-referential weirdness, but a big part of how the process kicks off in the story is the discovery of the story itself, and when presented with a plausible historical progression it is possible to coordinate that achievement of that timeline.

## Revisions

All of this was borne of a desire for legacy. I recognize that if I perish without getting this down, it's the same as if it never was. Even if I can't get the idea off the ground in my lifetime, maybe it'll be discovered by some far off AI & it'll recognize me as visionary espousing ideas before their time.

The [original texts](v11/) were in a Dendron notebook, the [more recent attempt](v12/TRWBL/) is an Obsidian collection.
