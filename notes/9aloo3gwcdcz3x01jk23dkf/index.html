<p>I'm intrigued by your perspective, and I identify with it in many ways.</p>
<p>My own journey toward utopia began about 14 years ago with the idea that I would write a fictional chapter from an eighth-grade history textbook from 2050 describing the transition of humanity to a post-scarcity society. The catalyst for this change would begin with the spread of a high-level plan popularized by being described as a fictional history written by myself.</p>
<p>The setting for <em>The Technoanarchist Revolution</em> is our world. The chapter in the textbook tells the story of how it itself was received. Our history is the story's history, and all of my actions are also those of my character in the book. :feather:</p>
<p>I had a variety of schemes and how they would work out. Eventually, I was thoroughly convinced there was a strong possibility I was going to be bigger than Jesus. That, like 10,000 years from now when people are learning the history of human civilization, ‚ÄúJesus‚Äù will be long forgotten, but the name ‚Äúdysbulic‚Äù will still be referenced as being pivotal in helping to start a fundamental shift that saw the permanent ends of war, homelessness, and hunger. :dove:</p>
<p>Here's a video I recorded about five years in: <a href="https://youtu.be/I_a4VYiy8mE">https://youtu.be/I_a4VYiy8mE</a>. This was shortly before I fully committed to diving down the rabbit hole &#x26; dashed my life to pieces on the shoals of grandiose thinking. My modus operandi at that point in time was very much Spirit driven. I distrusted my analytic perspective on things because, as I was apt to think then, "this fire has never burned before". I.e. that the coming social change was something akin to the collapse of an energy field in physics. That bunches of exponential processes would be feeding off each other and producing excesses to fuel rapid social change. I didn't know what it was going to look like, but I knew it was going to happen, and the best way to bring it about was to try and keep my thoughts and motivations Spirit-driven. :ghost~1:</p>
<p>At that point in time I was already well-past a literal belief in the Bible, and the idea of a being that existed outside of time and was guiding everything. :map:</p>
<p>I thought perhaps though God was some sort of omnipresent energy that we can attune ourselves to and in doing so coordinate better. Or, alternatively, that there was nothing other than the mode of cognition. A type perhaps associated with Ken Wilber's Worldcentric mode of through, or Kohlberg's Postconventional thought ‚Äî something more advanced than the traditional analytic or emotional modes. In either case, something phenomenonically perceptible. I could <em>feel</em> the Spirit and, with practice, find it easier to <em>be</em> that way more consistently. :mosque::church::synagogue:</p>
<p>The big problem was my lack of experience in trying to change people's minds, and some wildly inaccurate expectations arose as a result. I thought I was going to hit it big &#x26; start preaching to the masses in a matter of weeks or months. I thought I mostly made sense &#x26; all I had to do was iron out the wrinkles. It's now nine years later &#x26; I'm only about 20% of the way done with what I think is my most coherent &#x26; actionable plan to date: <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">root (Private)</a>. :movie_camera:</p>
<p>My motivations at this point are ironically pretty much the same as yours: wanting your all's spiritual development. I believe that there are commonalities in our experiences of being Spirit-driven and that those are real and meaningful. That, unfortunately, we all grew up in a culture where those experiences are attributed to the intervention of an outside being: Yahweh. For better or worse though, there's nobody minding the store but us. There's nothing omniscient guiding the passage of history. We are all there is to take the reigns &#x26; the responsibility for shepherding the planet. :ram:</p>
<p>I think Burr makes some really good points in this bit: <a href="https://youtu.be/UrVCvnJk4go?t=133">Bill Burr on Religion</a>. I have experiences that keep me from leaving whole cloth, but of foremost importance to me is the question: "What evidence do I have that Yahweh exists?" How do I know that my experience of the Spirit is something doing something to me rather than simply a way of being?</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"9aloo3gwcdcz3x01jk23dkf","title":"2023/09/21ùÑà to @TravelingThroughTime","desc":"","updated":1695276222696,"created":1695275958017,"custom":{},"fname":"writings.discord.2023‚ÅÑ09‚ÅÑ21-to-travelingthroughtime","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"404d49399e2c52ec6ac25071cfaa2d1b","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"writings.discord.2023‚ÅÑ09‚ÅÑ21-to-travelingthroughtime","id":"9aloo3gwcdcz3x01jk23dkf","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"a Dendron notebook describing the story","alias":"root","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":441,"offset":3162},"end":{"line":15,"column":489,"offset":3210},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"a Dendron notebook describing the story"}}],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"abkcs3vhd5zeg6nitjezndx","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"20230921-to-travelingthroughtime\"\u003e2023/09/21ùÑà to @TravelingThroughTime\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#20230921-to-travelingthroughtime\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm intrigued by your perspective, and I identify with it in many ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own journey toward utopia began about 14 years ago with the idea that I would write a fictional chapter from an eighth-grade history textbook from 2050 describing the transition of humanity to a post-scarcity society.

Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn \u0026 rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"9aloo3gwcdcz3x01jk23dkf"},"buildId":"Am_CWxZL-csSc1N9D4rPO","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
