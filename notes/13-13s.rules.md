There are only three hard-and-fast rules in the game:

1. No violence.
2. No theivery.
3. Be kind.

Violence is interpreted broadly to be in line with the Non-Aggression Principle *(NAP)* of anarchism.

For example, doing something that is likely to damage the water table is interpreted as violence. It isn't limited to simply physical interactions between players.
