The system knows:

* Parcels:
  * size
  * weight
  * id
* Holders: *(which can be cars or stationary locations)*
  * items held
  * time to a waypoint
* Waypoints:
  * coordinates
  * name

It specifically doesn't know anything about what's within the parcels. Frequently items will be shipped in reusable locking pouches. The seller communicates the lock code to the buyer and the courier doesn't have access.
