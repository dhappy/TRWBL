<p>My revolution tale is somewhat different from yours, but there are parallels‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Rather than a military coup, my transition is through the rise of a political party so fundamentally different from the establishment that when their candidate is elected President, it is regarded historically as a revolutionary event.</p>
<p>I've been trying to massage the story to the point it's not me who's elected President because I know describing that part of the story sounds like grandiosity &#x26; will turn off the vast majority of listeners.</p>
<p>The question is, "if not me, then who?" If there were a solid candidate, they'd be on the stage already and I am the only one with anything resembling a clear picture of how I hope to accomplish my goals.</p>
<p>I plan to mitigate the problem through a judicious application of radical transparency. The entire execution of the office will be livestreamed with interfaces to allow the public to participate.</p>
<p>The only real sticking point are our covert activities that would be compromised by a livestream. It'd be safe to do if war were somehow ended. My plans of how to accomplish that are still in formation, but developing new information networks to facilitate open conspiracies is a crucial component.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to be Dovokin from Zelazny's <em>Princes In Amber</em>. In the series the characters possess cards that warp reality in various ways. Toward the end it's revealed there's a gnome in the dungeon who's responsible for creating all these cards and allowing the Princes to be the Princes.</p>
<p>I want to be in the room with the President or whoever &#x26; it's always someone's in the room with me. You may be President, but I'm the one that brought an end to the bullshit. I'm pivotal in the end of war, homelessness, and hunger; helping to usher in a new post-scarcity age.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"mts6ffkneda9qi7udbblor1","title":"2023/10/09ùÑà to @TravelingThroughTime","desc":"","updated":1696892051264,"created":1696891965486,"custom":{},"fname":"writings.discord.2023‚ÅÑ10‚ÅÑ09-to-travelingthroughtime","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"7bb63903c3db7e2bb45c425be023c2d1","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"abkcs3vhd5zeg6nitjezndx","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"20231009-to-travelingthroughtime\"\u003e2023/10/09ùÑà to @TravelingThroughTime\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#20231009-to-travelingthroughtime\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy revolution tale is somewhat different from yours, but there are parallels‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than a military coup, my transition is through the rise of a political party so fundamentally different from the establishment that when their candidate is elected President, it is regarded historically as a revolutionary event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI've been trying to massage the story to the point it's not me who's elected President because I know describing that part of the story sounds like grandiosity \u0026#x26; will turn off the vast majority of listeners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is, \"if not me, then who?\" If there were a solid candidate, they'd be on the stage already and I am the only one with anything resembling a clear picture of how I hope to accomplish my goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plan to mitigate the problem through a judicious application of radical transparency.

We have enough shelter and food for everyone to have a share. The real issue would be the logistics. Tracking all the people and tracking where they eat and lodge.\n\nIt'd be alot better if it were a program coming not from the establishment. I want to try and sell black people on a plan for non-violent revolution beginning as a \"black\" club that one only gains membership to by being judged as \"black\" by the existing membership.\n\nOne could have their ‚ñõ‚ñü‚ñà·é∂·é∂‚ò∞Â∞∫ card revoked *(since that's what you're allowed say when you hold one)* as social censure. Maybe that's a perk of the black team‚Ä¶ Each team aims to satisfy one of thirteen basic needs. Black people's is drugs. They evolve a market with testing facilities between the production and distribution through blind couriers which doesn't rely on violence to mediate issues.\n\nWe aim to create a rat park where everything's available, but the populace is content enough that they don't abuse.\n\nThe main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[Yggdrasil|13-13s]] of which the Black team is one.\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nConceptually, _TRWBL_ is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.\n\nThe desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particularly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.\n\n## Synopsis\n\nAn organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn \u0026 rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"mts6ffkneda9qi7udbblor1"},"buildId":"-_BdjtpNi3N9r4gHlXsc7","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
