This is an idea for an event facilitation program.

1. An Owner maps a site and designates availability
1. A Host selects the site and time period they would like to reserve
2. A Host invites Guests to pick spaces for the duration
3. Guests make reservations for spaces
4. Guests specify substances they are interested in
5. Dealers can see all the users desires and can make bids for a house
6. Guests view bids and make specific purchasing requests
7. Some set of bids are accepted
8. Dealers individually seal each of the orders and mail it to the Collector
9. The Collector conglomerates all the packages into one parcel
10. The Bootlegger picks up the parcel, divides the orders into combination locked bags with a printed nfc card in the lock
	* The front of the nfc card is artwork provided by the Guests
	* The back of the nfc card is a QR code
	* The value of the nfc card is a url that returns the value of the QR code
	* There is a pouch on the bag such that the back of the card cannot be viewed without removing the lock
12. A piece of paper with the Guests alias is placed in the pouch along with the card
13. The bags are delivered to the site
14. The bags are distributed to rooms according to reservations
15. The Guest receives the bag
16. The QR code contains a link to get the combination of the locked
17. They authenticate to the app and confirm receipt
