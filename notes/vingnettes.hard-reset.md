The hard reset of a computer is to cut the power and restore it.

My idea for a hard social reset would be to record the development of a massive conspiracy.

The operation of the conspiracy is intertwined with everyday life, but given an alternate explanation in the work-a-day world.

At some point tens of thousands of hours of footage revealing the secret layer is published with AI targeted snippets tailored to members of the uninitiated to show them specific places where activities were going on under their nose.

Guides will use stickers *(often covering Ed25519-producing NFC tags)* placed in public places to locate events & materials within the goods network.

## Secrecy

An open question for me is what details need to be kept secret. It is theoretically possible that the existence of a conspiracy is known publicly, but it could still operate using hidden mechanisms and protect its operations.
