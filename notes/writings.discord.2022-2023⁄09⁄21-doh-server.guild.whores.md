> The whores guild ties in with several different aspects of the story:
>
> * Religiously, in Gianism, “God” is all life at any given moment. That which is holy is doing that which benefits the health of God, bearing in mind that each one of us is an aspect of the totality of all life. Orgasming, then, is taken as a sacred act of adding some bliss to the Godhead.
>
> The act of masturbating requires one to focus on the manual processes of stimulation and, oftentimes, detracts from the depth of the experience. “Worshiping” with a Gaianist could involve getting (or giving) a gloved hand-job (potentially with toys).
>
> If the risk of disease can be reduced to near zero, then the only issue at hand is the near universal disquiet most people experience when it comes to expressing sensuality. I want to create networks of health attestations (including lab tests) such that people can chose the extent of a sexual interaction (and choose partners) while minimizing illness.
>
> This also impacts the building of the Black & White teams that are the "illegal teams" attempting to satisfy needs for sex & substances. I heard a rumor that if someone accuses you of being a cop, you can either take off all your clothes or punch them in the face: cops aren't allowed to do either. Honestly, that sounds spurrious to me, but if their process of infiltrating the organization involves giving and receiving recorded sexual favors, it may give some level of protection.
>
> A big part of wanting to be a religion is the legal protections it incurs. I need a page with a good overview of the 13-13s with the ability to enroll as a Gaianist. Hmm, I'm looking at the internet on certified religious organizations in the U.S. & it says:
>
> > * the organization must organize and operate exclusively for the pursuit of one or more charitable purposes recognized by the IRS;
> > * the organization’s net earnings must not serve to enrich private individuals or shareholders (beyond reasonable compensation for services rendered);
> > * lobbying cannot make up a substantial part of the organization’s activities;
> > * the organization cannot intervene in political campaigns; and
> > * the organization’s purpose and actions cannot be illegal or violate fundamental public policy.
>
> It's those last two that are a problem. I want to try and get a believer President elected so that we can work toward a Caliphate. I want to create networks to distribute sex & substances orders of magnitude more safely than is being done now.
>
> I want to use the money from selling drugs to pay for the end of hunger and, with that threat removed from the table, the end of war with the huge economic windfall that would bring with it.
