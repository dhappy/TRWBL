As with most of its systems, the Technoanarchist approach to warfare involves lots of livestreaming.

There are, initially at least, very few soldiers. We could start with a single group, small enough to be non-threatening, say five people.

This team is on a search for the individuals with the most capability of ending gunfire. The goal is not to address the conflicts, but to transition the mechanisms of conflict to ones without violence.

So, initially, to stop all bombing. This group of five would be streamed traveling through conflict areas attempting to explain their purpose to get communications devices into the hands of those giving the orders.

Devices should make a genuine effort to avoid localizing of the user. "Enemy" leaders should be free to communicate without increasing their risk of reprisal.

As a sign of good faith, the accounts that they use should be able to contact each other. It creates a new robust network that could be used for planning attacks, but the goal is to demonstrate that we are about strengthening their infrastructure even when it creates a risk for us.

So what it ends up looking like is a small group of people (5 agents, 5 camerapeople, 5 support) giving out devices, training, and interviewing to figure out where to head next.

Everything should be conducted in the local languages. This means having the entire team be at least intermediate speakers.

This would all work so much better if Biden had the political will and capital to stop bombing. That's not anywhere near on the table currently to the extent it sounds unrealistic to propose it.

If the meme existed and was popular that this is feasible to do, and that Biden could be the one to lead the world out of dropping explosives from the sky, he might seize the moment.

Another, more controversial, aspect of the war movement is the storyline that the people who influenced the US government to stop bombing are in the process of forming a Caliphate.

The issue is that a Caliphate calls for a Caliph, and who would run the government and church I've envisioned other than me? It is at the point I describe my plan as including my being elected President and seen historically as a major prophet, is that it seems absolutely untenuous.

Especially the idea of people changing their religion and saying "the Holy Spirit exists and can guide my actions, but it doesn't exist outside of myself."

Especially especially the fundamentalists that I hope to be addressing in the crusade to end armed warfare.

It seems easier at times to address the problem of homelessness and hunger under the premise that without those it will become increasingly difficult to find soldiers.

Dealing with that problem on a global scale, however, is much easier if you can free up the resources currently going to defense.
