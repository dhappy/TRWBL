<p>As with most of its systems, the Technoanarchist approach to warfare involves lots of livestreaming.</p>
<p>There are, initially at least, very few soldiers. We could start with a single group, small enough to be non-threatening, say five people.</p>
<p>This team is on a search for the individuals with the most capability of ending gunfire. The goal is not to address the conflicts, but to transition the mechanisms of conflict to ones without violence.</p>
<p>So, initially, to stop all bombing. This group of five would be streamed traveling through conflict areas attempting to explain their purpose to get communications devices into the hands of those giving the orders.</p>
<p>Devices should make a genuine effort to avoid localizing of the user. "Enemy" leaders should be free to communicate without increasing their risk of reprisal.</p>
<p>As a sign of good faith, the accounts that they use should be able to contact each other. It creates a new robust network that could be used for planning attacks, but the goal is to demonstrate that we are about strengthening their infrastructure even when it creates a risk for us.</p>
<p>So what it ends up looking like is a small group of people (5 agents, 5 camerapeople, 5 support) giving out devices, training, and interviewing to figure out where to head next.</p>
<p>Everything should be conducted in the local languages. This means having the entire team be at least intermediate speakers.</p>
<p>This would all work so much better if Biden had the political will and capital to stop bombing. That's not anywhere near on the table currently to the extent it sounds unrealistic to propose it.</p>
<p>If the meme existed and was popular that this is feasible to do, and that Biden could be the one to lead the world out of dropping explosives from the sky, he might seize the moment.</p>
<p>Another, more controversial, aspect of the war movement is the storyline that the people who influenced the US government to stop bombing are in the process of forming a Caliphate.</p>
<p>The issue is that a Caliphate calls for a Caliph, and who would run the government and church I've envisioned other than me? It is at the point I describe my plan as including my being elected President and seen historically as a major prophet, is that it seems absolutely untenuous.</p>
<p>Especially the idea of people changing their religion and saying "the Holy Spirit exists and can guide my actions, but it doesn't exist outside of myself."</p>
<p>Especially especially the fundamentalists that I hope to be addressing in the crusade to end armed warfare.</p>
<p>It seems easier at times to address the problem of homelessness and hunger under the premise that without those it will become increasingly difficult to find soldiers.</p>
<p>Dealing with that problem on a global scale, however, is much easier if you can free up the resources currently going to defense.</p></div></div><div style="padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px" class="ant-col ant-col-xs-0 ant-col-md-6"><div><div class=""><div class="ant-anchor-wrapper dendron-toc" style="max-height:calc(100vh - 64px);z-index:1"><div class="ant-anchor"><div class="ant-anchor-ink"><span class="ant-anchor-ink-ball"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="ant-divider ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div><footer class="ant-layout-footer" style="padding:0 24px 24px"></footer></main></section></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"note":{"id":"877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r","title":"Warfare","desc":"","updated":1694080246310,"created":1694070085010,"isDir":false,"custom":{"isDir":false},"fname":"warfare","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"73a3c66802df33a923efc5b50c630b65","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":[],"parent":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","data":{}},"body":"\u003ch1 id=\"warfare\"\u003eWarfare\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#warfare\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with most of its systems, the Technoanarchist approach to warfare involves lots of livestreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are, initially at least, very few soldiers.

Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.\n\nThe needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.\n\n## How to Participate\n\n* The [[Silver team|13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement]] will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.\n* All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn \u0026 rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.\n* Money, in general, should be funneled into [[Code|13-13s.axes.projects#^code]] where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.\n","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"},"contentHash":"aaf678b782264ed02915d893cbcc6922","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s","alias":"Yggdrasil","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":84,"offset":397},"end":{"line":6,"column":104,"offset":417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement","alias":"Silver team","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":7,"offset":1367},"end":{"line":22,"column":57,"offset":1417},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.conglomerations.enforcement"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"ycfbd2a8x41gi0smmpufk0o","vaultName":"TRWBL"},"value":"13-13s.axes.projects","alias":"Code","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":46,"offset":1985},"end":{"line":25,"column":81,"offset":2020},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"13-13s.axes.projects","anchorHeader":"^code"}}],"anchors":{"bootstrapping":{"type":"header","text":"Bootstrapping","value":"bootstrapping","line":16,"column":0,"depth":2},"synopsis":{"type":"header","text":"Synopsis","value":"synopsis","line":22,"column":0,"depth":2},"how-to-participate":{"type":"header","text":"How to Participate","value":"how-to-participate","line":28,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u","ypu9ulohotwrez78fsejofb","t70n32fovw6k11p2ffwejej","dr794to5a3oswlo3dpjc8kv","877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r","sg2kjz4k4yrraezod6su58n","ybps4r8zc7a3wo185esfhi6","mmb0b8gqm9nh7uwsh6q7xhd"],"parent":null,"data":{}},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableExportPodV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"TRWBL"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enablePersistentHistory":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"dist","seo":{"title":"The Revolution Will Be Live","description":"A Story About Radical Social Change","author":"dysbulic"},"github":{"cname":"notes.trwb.live","enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub.","editBranch":"master","editViewMode":"tree","editRepository":"https://github.com/dhappy/TRWBL/"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"search","siteUrl":"https://notes.trwb.live","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"877hdm78cgmgv9e33ly0s4r"},"buildId":"mP6CrYgksDg6Lw0jz0Nl7","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
