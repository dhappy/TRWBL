Gaianism is designed to be the successor to Christianity and Islam. It respects the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought, but doesn't believe that it is caused by an omniscient being.

So, the structure of the church is much like existing ones, just the belief in the origin of the motivating experience is different.

So far as deity, “God” is all life at any point in time. Every organism is a part of the Godhead, and more complex composite aspects are formed by interactions between organisms.

## The Fall of Christianity

The primary tool to dismantle Christianity is to press on the concept of the virgin birth. To ask believers if they genuinely believe a virgin got pregnant, and then how they know that their experience of the Spirit originates outside their head.

Conceptually, the Christians we are looking to convert are relying on Social Proof to determine their beliefs. They look to their family and community to evaluate their structures. If an influential portion of the population *(some of whom could be existing atheists)* supports the position, it could shift things like a tide.

## The Caliphate

For the leader of the church to be the primary political leader is the Islamic end-of-days myth called the Caliphate after the Caliph: the person who heads the church that unifies the world.

That is what I would like my historical footprint to be. To found the church that unifies the world.

The crux is to respect the existence of the Spirit, and the reality of it as a mode of being. To have a society where being Spirit-lead is respected and encouraged, is definitely part of the goal, and so the concept of a Caliphate fits in several ways.


## Softwares

The Gaiainist church believes that several pieces of software can be created to aid in the lessening of human suffering.
