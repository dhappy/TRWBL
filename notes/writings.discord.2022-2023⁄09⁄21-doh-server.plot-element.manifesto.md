> I want to change how people consume, how they find lodging, how they decide how to spend their time.
>
> My obsession for the last few years has been the idea of a backward-chained revolution. A convincing story of a world without hunger, homelessness, and war with a detailed enough explanation of what behaviors people can adopt today to help bring it about.
>
> I want it to start with cleaning up the black market, specifically for drugs. I want them to be accessible, clean, and cheap. The 40-hour work week was begun in 1938. We don't have to work that much now. Drugs offer an activity which allows people to do almost nothing and have an enjoyable time.
>
> Moreover the existing market is militarizing (I think in response to the police) and provides specious quality at best. We can create something with a grounding rule that guns are inappropriate for interpersonal communication.
>
> I've been thinking in terms of roving cars with partners inside. There would be different roles they could play out: Driver, Courier, Clerk, Dispatcher, … I want to be able to organize the tactic I'm seeing in many police videos which is swarming an area with people.
>
> The story is still very much in process. My thinking has been that software on smartphones will be an integral part of how people find lodging and where to labor.
>
> I've been trying to build out what these interfaces might look like. I want to use the 13-sign accurate zodiac for delineating yearly events. The beginning of Capricorn on that calendar happens to be Inauguration Day (Jan. 20).

> Calendaring is important because I want to backward-chain events. For example, I'd like Joe Biden to stop dropping bombs on day one of office. I'd like to connect that event with somehow getting people to self-assign Decentralized Identifiers and creating trust networks.
