That's what I was hoping, but unfortunately the refresh rate on VTT subtitles seems to be around ⅒Hz, so it's too jerky for doing the animations.

Where I think it'll really shine is as part of one of the first apps I want to see developed by a serial mob: *Jervis*.

So, part of the long term goals is to have a sort of analogue to Amazon's infrastructure, but the goods are spread among vehicles and community operated depots. Critical to this infrastructure is an organization of couriers transporting stuff to consumers and betwixt depots. :red_car:

I want an Android application that:
* records the output of the front camera and correlates the footage with a WebVTT that gives:
  * the current GPS location
  * the closest address
  * the vehicle's speed
  * the current speed limit
* if the car runs afoul of law enforcement, the application will:
  * start recording out of both cameras
  * create a live stream of the footag                      e
  * connect someone qualified to give legal advice to the call
  * contact members of your immediate with a shareable link to the feed

I really like the idea of a cop being a cop & you get to reveal, you're being an ass in front of 50,000 people. :movie_camera::oncoming_police_car:
