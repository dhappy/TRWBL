> Software is orchestrated through leads meetings which are held in environments designed to cater to any reasonable need. President's Kitchens, brothels, & pharmacopias will be on hand.
>
> Work is done in terms of sprints aligned with the Hijri which uses lunar months.
>
> A team comes together at a location for a sprint. In the first week they triage existing issues, handle incoming requests, and project two-week goals. For two weeks they work on whatever they've chosen. Then for a week they fix tests and integrate with other teams.
>
> All programming is pair programming.
>
