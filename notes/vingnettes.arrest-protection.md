The [[Courier]] network will be, in part, distributing substances. The threat of an adverse altercation with the police is real.

If this happens, the goal is to have by that point established a network of operatives sufficient to surround the police station with more people than can be arrested and have them control vehicular access to the location with their bodies.

The demands would be simple: release our operative & we'll leave.
