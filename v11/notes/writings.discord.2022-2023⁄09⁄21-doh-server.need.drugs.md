When I found out one of these parties was happening, I did ~700km in ~48 hours: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nouakchott,+Mauritania/Banjul,+The+Gambia/ Unfortunately, I didn't really sleep on the way down & fell asleep shortly after getting hammered. :joy_cat:

The basic mechanism was a short term fictional autobiography which outlined the historical period where humanity graduated to a post-scarcity society and the specters of hunger, homelessness, & war were vanquished.

Christianity is grounded heavily in social proof - that right behavior is best determined by looking what your communities are doing. Good people go to church & believe, so to be good you be Christian.

> > That sort of holding mechanism should be vulnerable to shifting the believers opinion as to how popular the position is within their communities. Convince a few high profile people to start to sway the fringes and that spreads to more until a critical mass is reached & it tips to where the consensus opinion isn't that Yahweh exists.
> >
> > It wouldn't be as much about refuting Yahweh as offering an alternative theology where being lead by the Spirit is a real and meaningful cognitive mode, but it doesn't originate outside of the believers mind. The primary activity of the church is to infiltrate and subvert churches to take them over and convert the land they hold to electronically managed communal space.

> > The morality of actions can be judged simply on their own merits. So, specifically, this means many Gaians have very large numbers of sex and drug-fueled experiences.
> It was because of this part of the plan that I started wanting to find ways to slow the burn. If I were genuinely to start making serious inroads into dismantling Islam, there is a very high probability someone will murder me.

On the election of a US President somehow enmeshed in the scheme, all the footage is released. Some percentage of the population learns there's been a massive conspiracy that's been evolving around them for the last several years.

> > Since the timeline is grounded in the election of a radically different US President, there would be four expansions for five million coconspirators before election day. Between election day & the Inauguration there'd be the fifth expansion to bring us to ~68 million to prepare to release the footage to the world.

> > Ultimately, the story shifted again to it's highly unlikely I could control the virality of the existence of this scheme and my involvement, so more than likely a couple hundred million people learn the overarching concept in a spread I don't control. Enough people that I'm no longer convinced that there's not going to be a zealot gunning for me.

> > If that situation arises, I'll simply take to the seas and control who has opportunity to assassinate me. I was initially thinking an aircraft carrier, but research taught me cruise ships are larger & have many more floors. So, I model a cruise ship & the passengers in a computer and try to track the multitude of opportunities available at each juncture a Player is free to pursue something new. Bearing in mind that safe drugs and sex factor heavily into these machinations.

Then I'll go down for maybe six, followed by ~18 hours up, then I go down hard on Thursday & sleep perhaps 20 hours a day through to Saturday. I piddle around for a day or so & do it all over again the next week.
