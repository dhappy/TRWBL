> Provide a brief overview of your tool, library, or framework. What specific problem or inefficiency in the development process does it address?

My project consists of two arms working in coordination. The continual programming group aims to provide competent developer aid to smaller arrchitects, and the session recording review to evaluate progress and develop reputations from work.

> How does your project reduce development barriers, improve efficiency, or enhance the security of Web3 projects?

I envision the continual programming group providing a "many eyes make small bugs" environment as well as fostering a mentoring environment for less experienced workers.

One of my ultimate goals is that if I get hung up on an issue, I'll be able to push up my current work, record my progress, and return a day or two later to find that another mob sorted it in my absence. ðŸ˜¸

> Describe the current usage and support for your tool within the developer community. This could include GitHub stars, downloads, or testimonials from developers.

The current interface is the result of a hackathon project completed over a year ago. Since then there have been significant revisions and the current codebase is little more than a dream and the wandering hallucinations of some AIs.

> Outline your project's roadmap and how the grant funds will be used to achieve your development goals.

I'm currently working on the disillusionment of MetaGame. Once that's complete I'll have significantly more free time and, with the freedom the grant funds could provide, I hope to have a dog foodable product within two to three months.
