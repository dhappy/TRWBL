> A would be client connects to a group chat & introduces themselves. They can send messages to the staff on duty & unlisted guides can contact them.
>
> A guide & client meet up at a "safe" space. A location with a safe whose combination is known to the guide, but not the client or, more importantly, law enforcement.
>
> Guides is one of 13 guises under which you can request a visit. There's also Disciples, Enforcement, & others.
>
> A client has an agreement with an alliance that they can be detained for up to 48 hours (or whatever). The threat that Enforcement carries is still that of taking away time.
>
> If someone repeatedly infracted, their potential timeout time could be increased.
>
> I want to make a world where being non-violent is advantageous.
