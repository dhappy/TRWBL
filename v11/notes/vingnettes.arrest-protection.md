In my current vision, the revolution begins in the [J Van housing development](https://www.communityhousingpartners.org/properties/j-van-story-branch-apartments/): a half-block wide twenty story tall 350 apartment building in downtown Baltimore.

The system starts off with a shop that's accessible through an app. When someone orders something it is delivered to their room via a courier. The courier transports a locked sealed parcel where the code is transmitted directly between buyer & seller. Payment is direct and potentially escrowed.

It expands to delivery of parcels between rooms and eventually expands into the surrounding neighborhood.

## Goals

The overarching goals are:

* provide reputations via attestations
* allow perusing items for sale
* arrange for delivery of purchases

## Attestations

There are a variety of potential attestations, but perhaps the most important is the probability someone is a part of law enforcement.

Also, attestations are used to build seller profiles.

## Security

One of the options for security is to token gate everything. The question there is how large of a group could be mustered and be reasonably certain law enforcement wasn't holding? The answer is too small a group to be useful.

An alternative is attestations which are collected by a protected server. The server would then gate access to the market.

## Retaliation

Outside access is limited as much as possible, but in the case of an arrest for a crime committed on the part of the organization, a mob of people would descend upon the police station and prevent vehicular access with their bodies.

Doing this in a metropolitan area makes the situation different. In a rural location it's not infeasible that we could gather enough people they literally don't have room to arrest us all. In an urban setting, there are tens of thousands of potential cells which changes the math.

It should still be possible to muster enough people that for publicity reasons they can't all be arrested, but it's not as nice a safeguard as it being literally impossible.

Ideally though a response could be mobilized quickly enough that the confrontation happens at the initial point of contact before the arresting officers make it back to base.

At the least, vehicles could be used to restrict access while people gather.

There *could* be gatherings of people willing to obstruct traffic spaced throughout the operational area. Partying in safe locations unless a need for obstruction arises: “block” parties so to speak.
