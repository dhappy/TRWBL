My goal is to come up with an alternate system for the control of space & distribution of goods, & make them so that a percentage of the funds traveling through the system go into increasing the amount of space under the control of the system.

For my propaganda I want Tik-Tok length pieces showing people interacting with fictional pieces of software.

I just discovered [Globe.gl](https://globe.gl) which lets me easily draw paths on a 3D globe. The interaction I want to show is a person & AI collaborating to plan the traveler's living situation for the coming weeks and months.

Part of what you see on the screen is a tree of potential destinations with indications of the likely quality of housing that'll be available at each location. They can adjust their rank of where they'd like to go & how long they'd like to stay there so the AI can present them with an optimumish travel plan.

A major difference though is nobody has a permanent address. I think I want to have the system temporarily deed the held land to the owner du jour. Whatever it takes to give the holder the maximum protection under the law.
