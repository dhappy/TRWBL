Each of the [[13 teams|13-13s]] has a leader responsible for making certain early decisions such as who will populate their team initially.

There are three alliances: red, blue, and purple. Red is made of three teams that *must* be Captained by XX people, Blue is three XY-led teams, and Purple is seven teams led by anyone.

As the teams grow, most decisions should largely be passed on to voting structures of the entire populace though the captain will retain certain benevolent dictator powers necessary for efficient administration.
