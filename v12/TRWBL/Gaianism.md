One of the goals of the revolution is to supplant the Judaistic religions with one grounded in science.
## Basic Cencepts

One of the founding tenets of fundamentalist Christianity is that a virgin got pregnant. Vehemently holding such a nonsensical belief requires an active suspension of one's connection to reality.

Gaianism respect much of traditional Christian belief by generally respecting the teachings of Jesus *(though discarding some of the more bigoted words from the disciples)*, and recognizing the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought that is similar across people, but which originates in the "believer" rather than being the influence of an outside agent.

The major difference is a firm rejection of the existence of the omniscient and omnipotent being guiding reality: Yahweh. It doesn't forego the possibility of consciousnesses more complex than humanity's, but there is no being outside of time guiding events to work out for the best.
## Advantages

The benefits of forming a religion are:
* The churches hold an extensive set of properties, if it is possible to convert them to a new perspective.
* Legal protections for faith-based behaviors, specifically:
	* Gaianism posits that AIs can play a major role in the daily decision-making process, and one of the most important data sets that can be used to train said AIs is recordings of life events. Therefore, adherents would have reason to record all life events.
