# TRWBL: The Revolution Will Be Live

This is a work predicated on the concept that a sufficiently plausible series of fictional events leading from our world to one without war, homelessness, or hunger, can be used to bootstrap the process & encourage others to participate in causing the events to happen.

At it's heart, it describes the institution of theocracy. A global church that owns most of the land permitting its membership (which includes all life) as free of range as possible. An organization supported by a *voluntary* 10% tithe.

That the leaders of the church and the leaders of the State should be two different sets of people is ludicrous to me.

The faith of the revolutionary church is essentially Christian in theme, save that there is an absolute refutation that Yahweh (“יהוה”) exists. There is no wizard behind the curtain, just us.

It is imperative that we recognize that *nothing* guarantees things are going to work out for the best. There is no divine plan, just ours.

Economically, most of the funding for the [Gaianist Church](https://gaian.church) comes from a disintermediated market where consumers and producers interact more directly with perhaps one or two layers of distribution, as opposed to the many hands that currently take a cut at each step.

The church helps to develop the market and cultivate a coordinating set of AIs that handle different aspects of the distribution problem.

Everything is open source, and, in fact the revolution uses it's power over its memberships consumption patterns to force existing businesses to become transparent.
