# TRWBL: The Revolution Will Be Live

This is a work predicated on the concept that a sufficiently plausible series of fictional events leading from our world to one without war, homelessness, or hunger, can be used to bootstrap the process & encourage others to participate in causing the events to happen.

I fed a previous incarnation of this attempt to explain my ideas to [Google's NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) which generates an AI-hosted podcast discussing your concepts.

The AIs most decidedly didn't get any of the major points I'd attempted to bring out & generally misunderstood my intent. My assumption is this lack of comprehension arose from a weakness in my writing rather than a failing of the AI, so this is `v2`, now in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) *(whereas the previous version was [Dendron](https://dendron.so)-based)*.

*(I eventually learned I hadn't in fact fed my idea originally to NotebookLM. I only fed it one overview page. Thus my lack of depth. ðŸ˜¸)*

At it's heart, my plan is to architect a set of computer programs that combine to enable the execution of an augmented reality game called [Yggdrasil](Yggdrasil.md). The structure is there are 13 axes, like colors or months of the year or flags, and each team is associated with a set of 13 things â€” [one from each axis](13-13s.md).

One of the primary foci of the game is changing how space and resources are controlled. The purpose of money is primarily to get stuff and places, so an alternative system for distributing those could undermine the existing monetary system.
