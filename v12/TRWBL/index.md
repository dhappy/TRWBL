	# TRWBL: The Revolution Will Be Live

This is a work predicated on the concept that a sufficiently plausible series of fictional events leading from our world to one without war, homelessness, or hunger, can be used to bootstrap the process & encourage others to participate in causing the events to happen.

At it's heart, my plan is to eventually institute a theocracy. A global church that owns most of the land permitting its members free range. An organization supported by a *voluntary* 10% tithe.

It is essentially Christian in theme, save that there is an absolute refutation that Yahweh (“יהוה”) exists. There is no wizard behind a curtain, just us.

It is imperative that we recognize that *nothing* guarantees things are going to work out for the best. There is no divine plan, just ours.
