In some of the Yggdrasil Outposts, there are a wall of lockers with two doors in each. One side faces a “locker room” where someone with a key code *(or wallet signature)* is able to unlock a locker and retrieve its contents.

The other side is inside a sealed room, and it gives a Grocer space and privacy to stock the shelves & mark their contents.
