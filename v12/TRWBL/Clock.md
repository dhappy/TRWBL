# Decimal Clock

Time, for events organized by the revolution, are set to a ten-hour clock with a hundred minutes per hour and a hundred seconds per minute.

Despite less than half the number of hours per day, the granularity ends up being greater than the Babylonian 24 / 60 / 60 clock we currently use: 100,000 decimal versus 86,400 Babylonian seconds per day.

I've done several decimal clocks, with [the most recent](https://svelte.dev/playground/72dc800d737f4e079cfec52064a169c4) being in the Svelte Playground. [Another](https://z13cdn.web.app/) shows that the current date is negative — counting down to [the inauguration of a U.S. President in line with the revolution](Calendars#### 0⁄♑⁄0).
