There was a system for people to report when they planned on firing a gun & where. Areas like shooting ranges were exempt to allow for privacy.

When an unannounced shot was reported, Shot Cops would respond. Shot Policing took several different forms depending on the experiences of the participants. It always involved a pair of live streaming individuals approaching the areas where the shot was reported.

If it was an area with other people, they begin questioning those people if they heard a shot, and, if so, from where. The live streaming audience includes those who had the ability to control the output of a speaker carried by the pair, sometimes simply the handheld device, but more frequently through remote speakers capable of loud volumes.

The least autonomous was “remote” where most of the questioning was coming through the speaker.

Shot Police *(who were members of Yggdrasil’s [Silver Team](../teams/by/color/Silver%20Team))* were potentially backed up by a pair of marksmen who were also receiving instructions from the live-streamed.

Though it was never necessary, if the marksmen were force to shoot to respond to an imminent threat, they were to wait for [Gold Team](../teams/by/color/Gold%20Team) to come and intake them into the American Criminal Justice System.

If further shots were fired by anybody, it would trigger more shot cops.
