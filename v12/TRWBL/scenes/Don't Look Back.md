Prior to the Technoanarchists' revolution, the most common form of state-sponsored consequence of undesired actions was incarceration. The punishee was housed with other "inmates" in small concrete cells generally for a period of years.

The Revolution focused heavily on short intense periods of, hopefully transformative, targeted psychological interventions.

When they are released, before their eyes are uncovered they're given essentially Lot's edict when fleeing Sodom: don't look back. They're told that if they look back before they get to some fixed point they'll be under a more *active* sort of surveillance now that we've interviewed them and know how to find them.

The author of the story, described it as such:

>Honestly, what I'd like to do is if they turn around, they just see four hatted, masked, & glassed able bodies which then either quickly leave the scene, or, depending on the environment, they retake the agent & drive them to a new location where they are restrained & raped by a transexual. & by rape, I mean a gloved hand job given. If the subject was initially unresponsive, the process continued while the subject was exposed to pornographic materials recommended by an AI analyzing their responses and also giving recommendations to the rapist.
>Once they come we'll put them through obedience tests like the don't look back until we're convinced they're either good to release or we recognize that they're enjoying the orgasms & in that situation where 9 of 10 of these guys would ever admit to having been gotten off by a guy which is what we will probably let have them for the second rape if they are recalicitrant.
 Eventually we let them go back to their lives, but they know now that they're in whoever rapes them's books & if they misbehave &, say knee a person on the ground on all fours in the head *(as I recently watched an ICE agent do)*, there'll be consequences.

There was a focus on intermitent positive state positive reinforcement as opposed to the previous model of positive state negative reinforcement.

“Scared straight.” was a euphamism from the period meaning that one is good to avoid punishment. Revolutionary justice was focused much more on creating an environment where individuals saw the advantages to exhibiting prosocial behavior when in public.

Freedom was one of the thirteen core values, but there were periods where people or animals were restricted in their movements and perhaps briefly educated on topics the majority of everyone else
