title: The Revolution Will Be Live

March 14, 2026 was what many consider to be the true start of the Technoanarchists’ Revolution.

The scene is an impromptu ICE raid taking place at a bodega in New York City. Six Agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau arrived at the location at ~2ʜ in the morning. A perimeter was established & filled with conspirators.

Over the course of [2% of a day](https://dhappy.github.io/times/) *(~30 minutes)* people filtered into the scene to the point that they begin to crowd around the ICE Agents. At least four able bodies per ICE Agent &, ideally, three innocents *(women & children, particularly children)* per able body. Enough people to surround all their vehicles and persons.

At the sound of the signature whistle from [Michael Franti's _Ganja Babe_](https://youtu.be/iIQ23ZPTnTw) the crowd fell completely silent & still. Able bodies standing to the right and left of each agent “handcuffed” themselves to one of the agent's wrists with a device designed to give them control over that arm while minimizing the captured agent's ability to harm them.

At this point in time, handcuffs were primarily a tool of the police & were made of simple metal and would ratchet only tighter.

A recording on a portable speaker played:

 > “You are being detained by a rebellious alliance aimed at restructuring the United States government in part by providing alternative security services.
 > “Please remain calm and do not attempt to use any telecommunications. You will be transported to a different location where you will be identified and released.
 > “In addition to the individuals cuffed to you, there is a taser drawn at your back. If you overly struggle with the 'hand'lers at your sides, you may end up with volts poured into your posterior.”

The two cuffed handlers and captured agent were then picked up by a courier / navigator pair operating a vehicle. They drive to a rendez-vous point where the now blindfolded agent was transferred to a completely new set of both handlers and drivers.

The group traveled to a secluded location where the agent was interrogated to learn their identity and address.
