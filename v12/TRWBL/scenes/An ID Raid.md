title: The Revolution Will Be Live

March 14, 2026 was what many consider to be the true start of the Technoanarchists’ Revolution.

The scene is an impromptu ICE raid taking place at a bodega in New York City. Six Agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau arrived at the location at ~2ʜ in the morning. A perimeter was established & filled with conspirators.

Over the course of [2% of a day](https://dhappy.github.io/times/) *(~30 minutes)* people filtered into the scene to the point that they begin to crowd around the ICE Agents. At least four able bodies per ICE Agent &, ideally, three innocents *(women & children, particularly children)* per able body. Enough people to surround all their vehicles and persons.

At the sound of the signature whistle from [Michael Franti's _Ganja Babe_](https://youtu.be/iIQ23ZPTnTw) the crowd fell completely silent & still. Able bodies standing to the right and left sides of the agent “handcuff”ed themselves to one of the agent's wrists.

At this point in time, handcuffs were primarily a tool of the police & were made of simple metal and would ratchet only tighter.

A recording on a portable speaker plays:

 > “You are being detained by a rebellious alliance aimed at restructuring the United States government in part by providing alternative security services.
 > “Please remain calm and do not attempt to use any telecommunications. You will be transported to a different location where you will be identified and released.
 > “In addition to the individuals cuffed to you, there is a taser drawn at your back. If you overly struggle with the 'hand'lers at your sides, you may end up with volts poured into your posterior.”

The two cuffed handlers then walk the agent to a vehicle that they drive some distance away with a courier / navigator pair. At a rendez-vous point, the agents who are masked so their eyes are covered are transferred to a completely masked and unknown to the scene-based participants.

Again, the ICE agent is blindfolded, perhaps with opaque wraparound glasses when the transfer takes place. They are transported to an unknown location where we interrogate them about, at the very least, who they are and where they live.

When they are released, before their eyes are uncovered they're given essentially Lot's edict when fleeing Sodom: don't look back. They're told that if they look back before they get to some fixed point they'll be under a more *active* sort of surveillance now that we've interviewed them and know how to find them.

Honestly, what I'd like to do is if they turn around, they just see four hatted, masked, & glassed able bodies which then either quickly leave the scene, or, depending on the environment, they retake the agent & drive them to a new location where they are restrained & raped by a transexual. & by rape, I mean a gloved hand *(& at the rapist's discretion blow)* job given while watching porn recommended by an AI to get them to orgasm. Once they come we'll put them through obedience tests like the don't look back until we're convinced they're either good to release or we recognize that they're enjoying the orgasms & in that situation where 9 of 10 of these guys would ever admit to having been gotten off by a guy which is what we will probably let have them for the second rape if they are recalicitrant. Eventually we let them go back to their lives, but they know now that they're in whoever rapes them's books & if they misbehave &, say knee a person on the ground on all fours in the head *(as I recently watched an ICE agent do)*, there'll be consequences.
