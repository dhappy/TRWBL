In some of the Yggdrasil Outposts, there are a wall of lockers with doors in both front and back. The front faces a “locker room” where someone with a key code *(or wallet signature)* is able to unlock a locker and retrieve its contents without human intervention.

The other side is inside a protected room, and it gives a Grocer space and privacy to do the appropriate [transfers](Escrow) to stock the shelves.

Rhinegold is the software which manages access to the lockers which have electronic locks on both doors. It is receiving instructions on who owns what from [Jörmungandr](Jörmungandr), recalling that the Couriers and Grocer are both blind to the contents of the package, and only have access to the shipping identifier.
