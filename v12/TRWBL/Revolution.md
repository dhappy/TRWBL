## Funding

Initially the funds to support the software development that is at the core of the revolution come from establishing a reliable and violence-averse market for all sorts of substances.

Everything from Insulin to Weed will intersect consumers as they go through their lives via the [couriering network](Constant%20Couriering). Having undergone scientific measurement sufficient to accurately identify the exact composition of the substance being acquired.

This network will be expanded to contain a wider array of products, and eventually everything. We won't have buildings full of stuff where you go to buy it. All the stuff'll be moving around with the couriers and will come to you.

While the goal is to make a basic sustainable standard of living possible for free, many luxuries will still cost, and the [Gaianist Church](Gaianism) will ask for a tithe of ten percent.
## Nomads

Some of the most marked differences between our lives and those of those living post-revolution is:
* How we store our stuff.
* How frequently we sleep in the same bed.
* How often we travel to a new city.

Property ownership will be structured as short term leases. The [initial testbed](Silver%20Outpost%20№1) has a plan for three couches which will rent for twelve hour periods and come with a locker for the storage of a small number of personal items.

You won't need to have bunches of possessions because all the now unowned stuff is traveling around in a network of vehicles, lockers, and holding establishments trying to be close to where it will eventually be used.

## Process

The revolution takes advantage that many of our systems contain mechanisms for them to be obsolesced if a significant enough percentage of the population participates.

¿How do you take over the American Executive Branch? Elect a reformist candidate as President. ¿How do you take control of the supply chain? Structure markets to accrue goods over time & essentially buy everything.

One tactic that sounds productive to me is targeting businesses for takeover. We advertize to a company that we want to convert their resources to be controlled by a distributed permissioning network. We offer some buyout price, and then encourage all their customers to cease to be so as quickly as possible. We slash their profits until they bleed enough that they sell.

[Gaianism](Gaianism) attacks the ownership of churches in a similar way though there there is a conspiratory aspect to subvert the power structure of a congregation in secret until sufficient support is garnered for a takeover, then the trap is sprung all at once.
## World Domination

The revolution takes aim at three primary enemies of freedom in the world: China, Russia, & The Islamic State.

A common component to how all three are dealt with is the proliferation of mobile devices capable of accessing a planetary Internet for free.

Software will be developed to aid members of these countries develop conspiracies to enact social change. Hopefully, [Mïmis](Mïmis) & [its compatriots](Pantheon) will provide a sufficiently vetted source of news that genuine narratives can take hold and the members of that society will strive for healthier and freer structures.
