## Funding

Initially the funds to support the software development that is at the core of the revolution come from establishing a reliable and violence-averse market for all sorts of substances.

Everything from Insulin to Weed will intersect consumers as they go through their lives via the [couriering network](Constant%20Couriering). Having undergone scientific measurement sufficient to accurately identify the exact composition of the substance being acquired.

This network will be expanded to contain a wider array of products, and eventually everything. We won't have buildings full of stuff where you go to buy it. All the stuff'll be moving around with the couriers and will come to you.

While the goal is to make a basic sustainable standard of living possible for free, many luxuries will still cost, and the [Gaianist Church](Gaianism) will ask for a tithe of ten percent.
## Nomads

Some of the most marked differences between our lives and those of those living post-revolution is:
* How we store our stuff.
* How frequently we sleep in the same bed.
* How often we travel to a new city.

Property ownership will be structured as short term leases. The [initial testbed](Silver%20Outpost%20â„–1) has a plan for three couches which will rent for twelve hour periods and come with a locker for the storage of a small number of personal items.

You won't need to have bunches of possessions because all the now unowned stuff is traveling around in a network of vehicles, lockers, and holding establishments trying to be close to where it will eventually be used.
