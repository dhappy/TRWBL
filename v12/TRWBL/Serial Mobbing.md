A Serial Mob is akin to a pair programming session. In pair programming there's a Navigator who describes the program to write and the Driver who operates the UI and does the physical writing.

Often, programming pairs will have a more experienced Navigator & more junior Driver, since it is an excellent way to learn software development.

In mob programming, you have a group of 3â€“4 & people are shifting in and out of the Navigator and Driver roles every 20 minutes or so.

Those not actively Navigating or Driving serve as a real-time code review to hopefully catch any leaked secrets of egregious errors.

I want to have a pretty complete set of coding standards & an automated system for reviewers to submit changes to committed code that violate those policies.
