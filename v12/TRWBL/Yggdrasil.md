Yggdrasil is a system for managing short term leases on specific locations targeted down to the level of a single room, or even piece of furniture.

It also helps manage the user reputations within the game. A user has 13 sets of user records — [one for each team](13-13s).

One of the initial testbeds will be [the first Silver outpost](Silver Outpost №1).
