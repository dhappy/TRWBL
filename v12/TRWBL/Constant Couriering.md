To make it easier for producers to gain access to consumers, there will be a collection of goods that are distributed among groups of cars and short-term  storage locations.

Think of it as a Dollar General, but the products are spread out across the landscape & their storage is private: you shop online & the goods come to you.

Pricewise, there are a variety of factors at play:
* The courier system will run 24 hours a day and require two people per vehicle or storage house.
* The couriers will be delivering sold goods, transporting goods between storage houses, ferrying people, and serving as an ad hoc security service.
* As security service, the pair in a car serve as camerapeople to capture the activities of whoever contracted them.

An important aspect of the couriering system is the software that is managing the activities of the drivers and storekeeps. There are at least two systems at play: the dashcam & the coordinator.

The dashcam software is recording *(potentially livestreaming)* their progress & directing their driving.

When a courier gets pulled over, they have no idea what they are carrying. In general packages are sealed in tamper-evident packaging with a NFC-based identifier that can privately prove that it holds a secret key.

The coordinator is describing interactions as a series of exchanges of specific parsels at certain points in time. There are always two parties that sign for an exchange. Both acknowledge a set of things given & a set of things received.

There should be the possibility of incurring debt to be automatically cryptographically collected upon further sale on down the line. What happens if a collection of parcels is stolen? Dispatch couriers in groups of at least two so that in the case of robbery, there are witnesses to film the encounter. Both for the protection of the couriers, and as protection against false claims of robbery.

The question is how precisely the locations of cars & houses can be known by the public. In an ideal world, we could be completely transparent and publish notifications of need to a broadcast network. We would then receive potential contracts from others that help satisfy those needs.

There's the crucial aspect of privacy though â€” the realistic capacity to pretend to be like others. Knowing what we're consuming is problematic. Knowing how everything is getting moved around, however, is not, if the nature of what is being moved is kept secret.

I want someone in the specialty rock salt market to be able to find a quality supplier of salt, place a bulk order and break that into reasonable serving sizes, along with a lab certification of the substance they are purveying.
