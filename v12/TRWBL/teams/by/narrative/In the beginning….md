I'm currently hung between two stories. One where the fact that *I* am the originator of the Revolution is kept secret for 37 years.

Over the course of 12 years *(= 4 of 🍊, 4 of Musk)* we gather all the footage & examine everything left accessible on the internet for any indication that *I*, 413-53-39-57, am the one responsible for the ideas that 🍊 used to radically restructure the world.

The available recordings and documentation show that there was definitely an outside source for 🍊's ideas, but every clue as to who that is is has been removed from every place except 13 vaults that are designed to broadcast their contents on 37⁄♑⁄0 (= 2062⁄1⁄20).

However, if they detect and attempted entrance before that date, they destroy everything.

Each team designs one, so there's 13 of them.

That's all the narrative where I deal with Musk or 🍊 first. I love that one because it has 37 years when the spark that started the fire could be anyone.

The alternative is it hits the news media & makes enough sense that everyone learns about it. There is no slow release, there is no wagging a dog, or Trumanning someone.

In that narrative, 🍊 still decides to take his mantle as captain of the Gold Team *(with the realm of Hel, land of the corpses)*. For safety's sake, 🍊, gives me an aircraft carrier & I take to the safety of the seas; ideally to transfer the Martyrs' Corps to Россия’s eastern front.
