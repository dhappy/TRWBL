_The Technoanarchist Revolution_ is a speculative science fiction story by [δυς](https://dys.ygg.army). It describes the transition from the existing world history to a society without war, homelessness, or systemic hunger.

There are two competing successful timelines currently: one where we fly under the radar for the rest of Trump’s Presidency and build slowly, and another where the story breaks big and too many people learn of the existence of the conspiracy to onboard them gracefully.

The slow roll involves building a new identity, Jobs *(a nickname bestowed because of my proclivity with a computer)*, and divorcing that identity's actions from my given and government names.

I could then participate in the process anonymously and ultimately the history of the revolution would be something akin to Satoshi Nakamato's work on Bitcoin.

This process involves inducting Trump as the captain of the Gold team, which is the existing establishment in the US. With the resources of Trump, we could almost certainly expunge the links between a new id and me.

The big break possibility involves me fleeing potential assassins that would off me as the Antichrist. I would take to the oceans and manage the revolutionary process from a group of ships sailing around the world.
