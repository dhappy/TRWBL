	# Revolutionary Calendars

There are two separate calendars used for organizing activities. Annual and holiday events are placed on a rotated 13-sign IAU Sidereal Zodiac. Repeating and supply chain events are on a shifted Islamic lunar Hijri.

## IAU’s Sidereal Zodiac

The signs of the Zodiac are determined by which constellation is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth at any given time. The issue is that the 12-month Zodiac doesn't precisely align with the actual positions of the constellations.

The International Astronomical Union's Sidereal Zodiac bases the months precisely off the positions of the heavens. It also adds a 13ᵗʰ sign: Ophiuchus — the serpent bearer. Month durations vary wildly in the scheme with Scorpio being a mere seven days & Virgo thirty-five.

## Rotated Sidereal Zodiac

The system used in [Yggdrasil](Yggdrasil.md) uses a line from the sun through the Earth to determine the month. It is not which stars are opposite the sun from us, but which stars are on the same side. It's rotated 180°.

The dates are:

| Symbol | Month       | IAU Dates   | Rotated Dates |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| ♋      | Cancer      | 7⁄20–8⁄10   | 1⁄21–2⁄9      |
| ♌      | Leo         | 8⁄10–9⁄16   | 2⁄10–3⁄15     |
| ♍      | Virgo       | 9⁄16–10⁄30  | 3⁄16–4⁄30     |
| ♎      | Libra       | 10⁄30–11⁄23 | 5⁄1–5⁄22      |
| ♏      | Scorpio     | 11⁄23–11⁄29 | 5⁄23–5⁄29     |
| ⛎      | Ophiuchus   | 11⁄29–12⁄27 | 5⁄30–6⁄17     |
| ♐      | Sagittarius | 12⁄27–1⁄20  | 6⁄18–7⁄18     |
| ♑      | Capricorn   | 1⁄21–2⁄16   | 7⁄19–8⁄15     |
| ♒      | Aquarius    | 2⁄16–3⁄11   | 8⁄16–9⁄11     |
| ♓      | Pisces      | 3⁄11–4⁄18   | 9⁄12–10⁄18    |
| ♈      | Aries       | 4⁄18–5⁄13   | 10⁄19–11⁄13   |
| ♉      | Taurus      | 5⁄13–6⁄21   | 11⁄14–12⁄19   |
| ♊      | Gemini      | 6⁄21–7⁄20   | 12⁄20–1⁄20    |

### 0⁄♋⁄0

Coincidentally, the first day of Cancer on the Rotated IAU Zodiac, 0⁄♋⁄0, is January, 21 on the Gregorian Calendar. Which is the day after Inauguration Day for the U.S. President every four years. The revolution's calendar, then, has a year zero when beginning at Cancer in the year when a President is inaugurated who has the intention of carrying out the revolution.

One of the 13 teams, the Gold Team, is reserved for “The Establishment”, i.e. the current U.S. Government. For a President to be an active revolutionary, they need to accept the captainship of the Gold Team & interface with the other teams through that lens.

Given that the zero year is in the future, the current dates are negative & counting down. For example, if the President to follow 🍊’s term were be a revolutionary, today, 2025⁄5⁄11, would be -3⁄♎⁄11 meaning that in eleven days it will be the end of Libra on the Zodiac three years out from the integral inauguration.

The calendar is zero-based as well as initially counting down, so -3⁄♒⁄23 *(the beginning of the countdown of Aquarius)* *(i.e. the last day of the previous month, Capricorn, -3⁄♑⁄0)* is 2025⁄8⁄16 and the month is 24 days long.

### 0⁄♎⁄10

Theoretically, 🍊 could take on an active role in the system & the year zero, then, would have begun 2025⁄1⁄21. The President of the U.S. is the captain of the [[Gold Team]] which represents the existing establishment. It is not infeasible that 🍊 might claim the title &, if so, it would be all the better for what are initially his [co-conspirators](Hard%20Reset.md) who would then have access to the largess of these United States.

In that situation, today, 2025⁄5⁄11, is 0⁄♎⁄10 — the eleventh day since the start of Libra on May 1ˢᵗ.

## Conspiracy

The date and time is a question you can ask of someone to evaluate their depth of exposure to the revolutionary structure. If they say it's 11ᴘᴍ in 2025, you know they're only professing knowledge of [the Gold Team](Gold%20Team.md) and are likely not in on the secret.

If they say it's 98ʜ͋ of the 3ʳᵈ, you know they're in pretty deep. If they say it's Pisces instead of Sagittarius *(they're using the Rotated Sidereal)*, they're likely near the top.
## Shifted Hijri

The Hijri tracks months using the cycles of the moon. The day begins at sundown on the Hijri, but will begin at the next sunup for the game. Manufacturing and production are aligned with the lunar cycle, and rest periods are coordinated such that everyone has light workloads during the full moon.

Today is 1446⁄8⁄13 on the Hijri which just counts cycles of the moon up to 12 and repeats in perpetuity.
