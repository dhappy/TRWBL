Users will create ordered lists which will be combined to produce new ordered lists personalized for individual users by Skuld, the fate concerned with the future.

An important criteria in determining which content to include in a user's list is whether they have viewed the piece of content previously & how they reacted to it. Urðr, the fate concerned with the past, will track content consumption, reactions, and rankings.

Verðandi, the fate concerned with the now will be ranking the lists ordered by Skuld and choosing which content to present to the user.
