An important factor in the [serial mobbing](Serial%20Mobbing) is evaluation of the decisions made during the coding sessions. Reactions made by peers to the recordings are conglomerated to produce evaluations.

Reactions are user defined in terms of a pictogram, a set of descriptors and weights, and, optionally, a target. The pictogram is used for display, but the weighted descriptors are used for interpretation.

The weight goes from -1 ≤ ꞷ ≤ 1, so reactions can be facetious, like a gold medal that has a descriptor "bright"→-0.75.

The target specifies which participants on the call the reaction is aimed toward.
