## Decimal Clock

During the French Revolution, they attempted to convert timekeeping to a  ten-hour clock with a hundred minutes per hour and a hundred seconds per minute.

## Percentage Clock

Times, for events organized by the revolution, are on a clock with a hundred hours per day, a hundred minutes per hour, and a hundred seconds per minute. On this clock, the time is simply the percentage of the day that has passed with minutes and seconds simply providing greater precision.

The granularity of the hundred hour clock is, of course, much greater than the Babylonian 24 / 60 / 60 clock we currently use. There's 1,000,000 percentage versus 86,400 Babylonian seconds per day, or about 11½ times as many.

I've done several decimal clocks, with [the most recent](https://svelte.dev/playground/72dc800d737f4e079cfec52064a169c4) being in the Svelte Playground. [Another](https://z13cdn.web.app/) shows that the current date is negative — counting down to [the inauguration of a U.S. President in line with the revolution](Calendars.md#0⁄♑⁄0).
