Mob programming is a cousin of pair programming. In pair programming there's a Navigator who describes the program to write and the Driver who operates the UI and does the physical coding.

Often, programming pairs will have a more experienced Navigator & more junior Driver, since it is an excellent way to learn software development.

In mob programming, you have a group of 3â€“4 & people are shifting in and out of the Navigator and Driver roles every 20 minutes or so.

Those not actively Navigating or Driving serve as a real-time code review to hopefully catch any leaked secrets or egregious errors.

The comings and goings of the mobsters is staggered so there are always at least three participants to keep things going.

Incoming shifts overlap with outgoing shifts for a brief period to allow the new worker to acclimate to the current status of the project and issue priorities.

I want to have a pretty complete set of coding standards & an automated system for reviewers to submit changes to committed code that violate those policies.
