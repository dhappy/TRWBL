Mob programming is a cousin of pair programming. In pair programming there's a Navigator who describes the program to write and the Driver who operates the UI and does the physical coding.

Often, programming pairs will have a more experienced Navigator & more junior Driver, since it is an excellent way to learn software development.

In mob programming, you have a group of 3–4 & people are shifting in and out of the Navigator and Driver roles every 20 minutes or so.

Those not actively Navigating or Driving serve as a real-time code review to hopefully catch any leaked secrets or egregious errors.

The comings and goings of the mobsters is staggered so there are always at least three participants to keep things going.

### Shifts

Shift changes are aligned to a [percentage clock](Clock) with 100 hours in a day corresponding to the amount of the day that has passed.

Incoming shifts overlap with outgoing shifts for a brief period to allow the new worker to acclimate to the current status of the project and issue priorities.

### Payment

The goal is to have a base rate of ~$15 ⅌ Babylonian *(traditional)* hour, but scaled to the 100 percentage hours *(“ʜ͋”)*, which are 14.4 minutes apiece. That would be $3.⁶⁰ ⅌ ʜ͋.

### Coding Standards

I want to have a pretty complete set of coding standards & an automated system for reviewers to submit changes to committed code that violate those policies for rewards.

### AI Assistance

The mob should have voice access to an AI agent they can query or delegate tasks to.
