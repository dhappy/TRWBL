The [calendars for the post-revolution era](Calendars.md) will [kick off with the inauguration of a U.S. President](Calendars.md#0⁄♑⁄0).

I thought for a bit that it made the most sense for me to do it since it's "my" story & who else has the vision.

After watching some C-SPAN, and recognizing the composure of long-term politicians as something I don't have much of or desire to have, I think it ought to be an existing Progressive.

For better or worse, Bernie's too old. The only other ones that come to mind are A.O.C. & Mamdani. Personally, I think it's time for a woman President.

What makes it Technoanarchist is three things:

* A publicly live-streaming camera has a right to witness *(pretty much)* all of the execution of office.
* There is some sort of interface to surface commentary from the general public.
* Sybil-resistant polling software is in place with an identity sufficient to recognize which jurisdictions one can vote in.
