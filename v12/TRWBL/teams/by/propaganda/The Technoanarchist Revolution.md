### The Technoanarchist Revolution

* **2011:** @dysbulic has a quasi-psychotic break & sets out to write _The Technoanarchist Revolution_, the story of the transition from the extant timeline to one without war, homelessness, or hunger.

Based in a world with increasingly extreme wealth inequality, the primary focus is to change the mechanisms used to determine access to space and resources.

> “It won't matter that five guys hold as much wealth as 80% of the U.S. population if all that money doesn't give them access to the best experiences.

The videos of the police brutality shared via the communication devices distributed throughout lead to marches across the country organized in part through applications distributed on the aforementioned devices.

There is a movement to control access to these devices, but concealing them is easy & they were being imported at a rate of hundreds of thousands per day.

**2029:** Musk is inaugurated as the 48ᵗʰ President of the U.S.. After a significant emotional re-education from his “red pill” days of the twenty-teens & early 2020s, Musk arises as a beacon to the left throwing his considerable wealth behind a variety of philanthropic projects aimed at putting resources under the control of a variety of AIs for equitable distribution.

The bulk of the AIs are originally created by the Gaianist church which holds that eventually reaction-perfect models of individuals will be 

**2037:** It is released that @dysbulic was the originator of many of Musk's plans & they are inaugurated the 49ᵗʰ President.

Continuing a process spearheaded by Musk, δυς livestreams the entirety of the execution of his official duties. By this time war has ended & there are no longer state secrets that must be held.
