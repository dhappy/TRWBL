The legion is the body of the church.

It is involved in a massive conspiracy to enforce an alternate standard of behavior while protecting its membership from repercussions within extant systems.

You might cross the wrong person in the wrong way & find yourself disappeared for a traumatic three day stint.

The idea is the legion doesn't take years from your life. They'll take a fortnight at most, but those hours will hopefully be sufficiently experience dense that it alters your future behavior.

Also, you'll know in the future that you're on legion's radar.
