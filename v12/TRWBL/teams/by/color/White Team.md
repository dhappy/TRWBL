## Sex

The basic idea is that it should be as easy as possible to find a partner to help one achieve orgasm.

Masturbation requires a division of attention that undercuts the whole experience.

If that means a gloved handjob given by someone you don't find remotely attractive *(for example, same sex for a person who's vehemently not gay)*, so be it.

A major push in the charge for assisted orgasms is significantly reducing the threat of violence & hopefully creating an environment where more people feel comfortable engaging.
