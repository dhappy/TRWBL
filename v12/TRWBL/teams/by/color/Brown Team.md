## Hearthkeepers

For any given space, “ownership” is through a layering of controls by various teams. The primary consequence of ownership is the ability to have someone else removed at your discretion. Far example:

1. Cyan controls the base substrate. They claimed the Universe and everything in it. That means Cyan can kick anyone from any place though they'll exercise this ability rarely if at all.
2. The globe is divided among the six red and six blue teams of the homme's and femme's alliances. *(French is used because in English the word for woman or female derives from the male.)*

	The Brown team is one of the red teams and the goal over time is to transfer control of the board to women.
	
3. At the level of cities, three of the remaining purple alliance members hold all the cities.
4. Within cities, one of the purple alliances will manage buildings. Another will manage outdoors spaces.
5. The Silver Team has a hold on every space & can kick anyone. Their role is rules enforcement, should someone refuse to vacate.

## Crime and Punishment

Trials are distributed. Each side creates a list of witnesses & calls with each are scheduled for a video call with the council for each side & a judge. From this & other footage, each side prepares a video outlining their case which is reviewed by a judge for admissibility and whatnot. A jury pool is convened online with the ability to critique and communicate on the sides' videos.

The question is where to get the judges and pay for everything.

There are Silver *(rules enforcement)* and Orange *(enforcement protection)* teams. There is another one for rules interpretation *(lawyers, judges, etc.)* that provides judges and legal representation for [couriers](Gray%20Team).
