A ‚Äúhard reset‚Äù is a term from computer science to describe cutting power to the system and then restoring it for a complete reboot.

In revolutionary narrative terms, it refers to building a hugely complex conspiracy that operates secretly in plain sight, recording much of its operation over the course of years, and then releasing all of the footage at once.

Those who had been operating unbeknownst within the structure would be faced with the knowledge that much of what they believed about the world & the structure of society is demonstrably false.

## Feasibility

A hard reset only makes sense if the existence of the revolutionary plot can be kept secret from the general population.

In a situation where, say üçä is the first revolutionary President, ideas like [the Martyrs‚Äô Corps](Martyrs‚Äô%20Corps) could be implemented with credit given to members of his staff. It would only be years later in the hard reset that footage is released revealing their true origin.

The issue with keeping things a secret is it runs counter to the idea of open-sourcing the development, both from a talent & a financing perspective.

It would take the involvement of a well-resourced actor to make this possible, and this currently seems both unlikely & potentially onerous in terms of oversight.
