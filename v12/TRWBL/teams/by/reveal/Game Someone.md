In The Game, the protagonist has unimaginable wealth, but is deeply dissatisfied. He signs up for a “game” which ultimately sees him jumping through a skylight to end it all, only to fall into a stuntmans' air bag.

Every decision he has made through the course of the last few weeks has been intimately influenced by the people running The Game.

## J’s Induction

I want to script a couple lives like that, starting with my once finacée, J.L.P., who absolutely should get a captainship.

I'd like to put J. through an absolutely bizarre week which culminates with me asking her to marry me with a ring in tow this time.

I was very preoccupied with The Revolution throughout much of our relationship & was decidedly distracted.

I want to find out what city she's in & go be homeless there with perhaps occasional flights out to organize logistics.
