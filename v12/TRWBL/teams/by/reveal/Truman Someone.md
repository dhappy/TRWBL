I want to slowly reveal to the world that a revolution has taken place & there's been a massively entertaining alternative to the work-a-day world in an AI-managed lifestyle that, literally everyone has been participating in for most of this person's life without their knowledge.

Frequently having cameras in your vicinity becomes normal if no one else seems to mind.

Because who is our Truman? Who will have to wait 13 years from the Inauguration of the 48·µó ∞ President *(or 9 if üçä enters into the game before the end of his term)*. Particularly if we manage to keep it a secret I exist for the remainder of üçä's term & his administration takes credit for coming up with alot of my ideas.

## Player Pool Growth

The way the game grows is through clusters of 12 plus oneself. So, there's an initial 13 captains, and for the first expansion, each of those 13 creates a new group of 13 that includes themselves. The next set of rounds begins again with the captains, then they people they added in the second round each get to add 12 more. It then repeats, each of the added groups getting to add 12 people apiece for a progression like:

| Iteration | New     | Total         | Equation                      | Description                                                   |

The next power of 13 is 4,826,809, which, worldwide *might* be a manageable number of participants, but it seems likely the secret would get out at that point.

So, *someone* has to be elected President after üçä finishes his second term. Say, Musk manages some major meta-cognitive reform & becomes palatable. He goes for eight years, during which we winnow down the number of people aware of the conspiracy down to a single person.

At the end of the next President's eight years, we reveal to our Truman that something has been afoot for over a decade.

## Advantages

In order for the revolution to play out in secret, once Truman was picked, it couldn't break in the news that person has access to. Keeping it a secret from just one person requires controlling how the information is disseminated in complex ways.

## Feasibility

Given how ravenous social and news media are for content, the idea of keeping anything this big a secret, even in the name of art, is silly. There will be too many people opposing various aspects of the plan that would want to sabotage it.
