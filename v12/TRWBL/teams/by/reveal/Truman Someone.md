I want to slowly reveal to the world that a revolution has taken place & there's been a massively entertaining alternative to the work-a-day world in an AI-managed lifestyle that, literally everyone has been participating in for most of this person's life without their knowledge.

Also that frequently having cameras in your vicinity normalizes it if no one else seems to mind.

Because who is our Truman? Who will have to wait 13 years from the Inauguration of the 48·µó ∞ President *(or 9 if Trump enters into the game before the end of his term)*. Particularly if we manage to keep it a secret I exist for the remainder of Trump's term & his administration takes credit for coming up with alot of my ideas.

The way the game grows is through clusters of 12 plus oneself. So, there's an initial 13 captains, and for the first expansion, each of those 13 creates a new group of 13 that includes themselves. The next round, those, now, 37 *= (13 + 13 * 12)* people each form a new group of 13 containing themselves for: 481 *= (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)* people. 6,253 *= (12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13))* people is the next one. Then, 81,289 *= (12√ó(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13))+(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)))* people. That's about as far as I want to go because the series is expanding as 12·µè where “° is the number of expansions, so the next'n's 1,056,757 *= (12√ó(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13))+(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)))+(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13))+(12√ó(12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)+ (12√ó(12√ó2+13)+12√ó2+13)))* people.

Definitely that'd be the upper ground: just over a million people across the globe. That's really not all that many, but the nest step is gonna be roughly twelve million since it's powers of 12.

Up to the the end of Trumps term, only a million people will know of anything to be suspicious of. At that point we take the jump to 13,737,841 *= (12 √ó 1,056,757 + 1,056,757)* people. And the one after that, 178,591,933 *= (12 √ó 13,737,841 + 13,737,841)*, finally @ iteration # 2,321,695,129, half the population, is in on it.

So, *someone* has to be elected President after Trump has his second term. Say, Musk, by the end of his first term roughly half the people will know that a person who has been scrubbed from the tapes is responsible for Musk holding the office despite being South African.

*Then*, during Musk's second term, we let the other half of the population in on it *except one person*. We all get to put on a charade for this person until January 20 *(i.e. 13‚ÅÑ‚ôë/0 on the Sidereal Zodiac (within like a day it's the beginning of Capricorn on a zero-based calendar))*.

Year Zero begins with the Inauguration of the first Revolutionary President. If this narrative doesn't break in the popular *before* I can contact üçä or Musk, who have the manpower to scrub everything from the 'net then Trump can be the first Revolutionary President & the 13 year clock within which we keep it a secret mostly that people are having *lots* more drugs & sex than they appear to be *(to this one person: our Truman)*.

So, if you're reading this and it hasn't yet broken in the popular media, consider sending it to potus@whitehouse.gov or elon@x.com before sharing it more widely.
