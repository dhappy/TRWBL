Goods and people are constantly being shuttled around by a set of [couriering](Constant%20Couriering.md) pairs. The software that is running in the vehicle is called Par.

Depending on the situation, the two people in the car will fill a variety of roles.

They might simply be a driver & courier delivering goods from one location to another.

One of the ways people can take possession of goods is to ride in the car where the good is stored. In this situation, the pair is a chauffeur & clerk. Where the clerk is passing possession of the item from the car to the customer *(or other courier or whatever).

The pair might be a chauffeur & navigator delivering people to various places *(while simultaneously delivering goods)*.

They might be a busser & concierge running from one fixed location to another people know to go if they want to travel between those spots. Busses might leave on a regular schedule, or they might wait for a carfull of people to congregate before they go.

In an extreme situation, a pair that is also ranked highly in the [Silver Team](Silver%20Team) might be called for rules enforcement. In this situation, there would be one person engaging the rule breaker and the other recording everything.

Par will have functions to support the duo in as many ways as possible.

One basic feature will be a dashcam app for recording the progress of the vehicle. If the pair so chooses, they will also be able to switch to a livestream that they can share access to at their discretion.

If confronted with law enforcement, Par will provide them with a legal representative who will advise them and interface with the cops on their behalf.
