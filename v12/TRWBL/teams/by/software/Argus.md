Argus is a system that people feed potential events into & helps people decide what will happen where.

A bot that interacts with Argus is some sort of gamesman that organizes brackets of competition in various sports.

I'm particularly interested in low coordination single-player type things like skee ball. You might get a notification you're playing in the tenth round against @so&so, & you both have 24 hours to roll your game somewhere.
