There is a huge quantity of unowned resources travelling through the [couriers' network](Constant%20Couriering.md). Kaup is the interface for users to describe their desires, peruse the available offerings and schedules, and to ultimately select what they want to receive.

Unlike the modern housing situation, people won't have a single fixed address they always go back to. Their possession will consist of a series of [short-term *(12 hours to, say, five days)* leases](Hestia) on locations.

So Kaup isn't just about selecting a product. It's about choosing what resources will be available at which spots along their planned travel trajectory.
