 Hestia is a system for managing short term leases on specific locations targeted down to the level of a single room, or even piece of furniture.

One of the initial testbeds will be [the first Silver outpost](Silver%20Outpost%20№1.md).

The goal is to change how access to space is mediated such that:
* Everyone has access to shelter.
* Space is used as much as possible.

## “Prisons”

One common point of discussion in anarchist circles is how to handle people who are apparently unavoidably prone to violence.

Control of space is three-tiered via teams. There is a team that controls the land, one for the structures, and one for the rooms.

Cases will be compiled where evidence is presented of various infractions. Modern jurisprudence relies heavily on rules of evidence to structure its arguments. Videos laying out the competing narratives could be compiled & then reviewed by the [teams](13-13s) after which they choose not to rent to the individual for public safety.

There will be a team of last resort which controls locations that are sparsely furnished & have [Silver](Silver%20Team) members on ready call.

The primary function of leasing a space is getting the right to tell anyone else to leave. Silver serves to enforce that right in the face of physical opposition. When Silver takes someone, they coordinate with the other teams to determine an area where the individual is allowed to be and transport them there.
