The goal is to abolish traditional physical goods markets in favor of a “fractured market” where the goods are held jointly by storage locations and transport media.

Each item in the system has a NFC tag with a unique identifier on it for tracking.

Jörmungandr is the system that is “aware” of all the parcels as well as NFC tags used to mark locations. It coordinates with [Par](Par.md) to move packages around in response to customer demands and likely consumption patterns.

Holding stations may be [electronic lockers](Rhinegold.md) or [human-managed spaces](Ladon.md).
