One of the central questions for [the courier network](Constant%20Couriering.md) is how to prevent theft. This is accomplished by the distributor assigning a value to each parcel they ship & before another party can take possession, they have to stake that assigned cost to be forfeit if they are found responsible for its loss.

Adjudication is done through a distributed process where jurors are chosen at random to view a presentation on the case and render a verdict.

The process is similar to what is done now with opening arguments and closing arguments. In the middle though will be some sort of media presentation by both sides. I'm thinking something akin to the true crime shows that are so popular currently. 

Examinations of witnesses could happen via teleconference & a recording of it made available to both sides for use in their presentations.

Legal representation means having access to a technically competent litigator to present the story. The rules of evidence should still be applied with presentations being reviewed by someones versed in the rules prior to trial.

If a trial verdict is within 13% of being balanced (i.e. 5/4 on a 9 person panel or 6/7 on a 13) then an appeal may be made to repeat the process with a new panel and presentations.

Revisions are possible to presentations, but doing so triggers an new round of preparations.
