# Revolutionary Calendars

There are two separate calendars used for organizing activities. Annual and holiday events are placed on a rotated 13-sign Sidereal Zodiac. Repeating and supply chain 
events are on a shifted Islamic lunar Hijri.

## Sidereal Zodiac

The signs of the Zodiac are determined by which constellation is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth at any given time. The issue is that the 12-month Zodiac doesn't precisely align with the actual positions of the constellations.

The Sidereal Zodiac bases the months precisely off the positions of the heavens. It also adds a 13ᵗʰ sign: Ophiuchus — the serpent bearer. Month durations vary wildly in the scheme with Scorpio being a mere seven days & Virgo thirty-five.

## Rotated Sidereal Zodiac

The system used in [Yggdrasil](Yggdrasil) uses a line from the sun through the Earth to determine the month. It is not which stars are opposite the sun from us, but which stars are on the same side. It's rotated 180°.
### 0⁄♑⁄0

Coincidentally, the first day of Capricorn on the Sidereal Zodiac, 0⁄♑⁄0, is January, 20 on the Gregorian Calendar. Which is also, Inauguration Day for the U.S. President every four years. The date on the revolution's calendar, then, is currently counting down to the day a President is inaugurated who has the intention of carrying out the revolution.

For example, if we assume the President to follow Trump’s term will be a revolutionary, today, 2025⁄2⁄12, would be -3⁄♐⁄4 meaning that in five days it will be the end of Sagittarius on the Sidereal Zodiac three years out from the fated inauguration.

The calendar is zero-based and -3⁄♒⁄22 *(the beginning of the countdown of Aquarius)* *(i.e. -3⁄♐⁄0)* is 2025⁄3⁄11 and the month is 23 days long.

The countdowns continue until 2029⁄1⁄20 which, since the flip is when the President is inaugurated and it is also the beginning of Capricorn on a now incrementing calendar, is 0⁄♑⁄0.

### 0⁄♐⁄16

Theoretically, Trump could take on an active role in the system & the year zero, then, would have begun 2025⁄1⁄20. The President of the U.S. is the captain of the [[Gold Team]] which represents the existing establishment. It is not infeasible that Trump might claim the title &, if so, it would be all the better for what are initially his [co-conspirators](Hard%20Reset) who would then have access to the largess of these United States. 

In that situation, today is 0⁄♐⁄16.

## Conspiracy

The date and time is a question you can ask of someone to evaluate their depth of exposure to the revolutionary structure. If they say it's 11ᴘᴍ in 2025, you know they're only professing knowledge of [the Gold Team](Gold%20Team) and are likely not in on the secret.

If they say it's 98ʜ͋ in the 3ʳᵈ, you know they're in pretty deep. If they say it's Pisces instead of Sagittarius *(they're using the Rotated Sidereal)*, they're likely near the top.
## Shifted Hijri

The Hijri tracks months using the cycles of the moon. The day begins at sundown on the Hijri, but will begin at the next sunup for the game. Manufacturing and production are aligned with the lunar cycle, and rest periods are coordinated such that everyone has light workloads during the full moon.

Today is 1446⁄8⁄13 on the Hijri which just counts cycles of the moon up to 12 and repeats in perpetuity.
