Annual and holiday events are placed on a rotated 13-sign Sidereal Zodiac. Repeating and supply chain\nevents are on a shifted Islamic lunar Hijri.\nSidereal Zodiac\nThe signs of the Zodiac are determined by which constellation is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth at any given time. The issue is that the 12-month Zodiac doesn’t precisely align with the actual positions of the constellations.\nThe Sidereal Zodiac bases the months precisely off the positions of the heavens. It also adds a 13ᵗʰ sign: Ophiuchus — the serpent bearer. Month durations vary wildly in the scheme with Scorpio being a mere seven days &amp; Virgo thirty-five.\nRotated Sidereal Zodiac\nThe system used in Yggdrasil uses a line from the sun through the Earth to determine the month. It is not which stars are opposite the sun from us, but which stars are on the same side. It’s rotated 180°.\n0⁄♑⁄0\nCoincidentally, the first day of Capricorn on the Sidereal Zodiac, 0⁄♑⁄0, is January, 20 on the Gregorian Calendar. Also, Inauguration Day for the U.S. President every four years. The date on the revolution’s calendar, then, is currently counting down to the day a President is inaugurated who has the intention of carrying out the revolution.\nFor example, if we assume the President to follow Trump’s term will be a revolutionary, today, 2025⁄2⁄12, would be -3⁄♐⁄4 meaning that in five days it will be the end of Sagittarius on the Sidereal Zodiac three years out from the fated inauguration.\nThe calendar is zero-based and -3⁄♒⁄22 (the beginning of the countdown of Aquarius) (i.e. -3⁄♐⁄0) is 2025⁄3⁄11 and the month is 23 days long.\nThe countdowns continue until 2029⁄1⁄20 which, since the flip is when the President is elected and it is also the beginning of Capricorn on a now incrementing calendar, is 0⁄♑⁄0.\n0⁄♐⁄16\nTheoretically, Trump could take on an active role in the system &amp; he year zero, then, would have been 2025⁄1⁄20. The President of the U.S. is the captain of the Gold Team which represents the existing establishment. It is not infeasible that Trump might claim the title &amp;, if so, it would be all the better for what are initially his co-conspirators who would then have access to the largess of these United States.\nIn that situation, today is 0⁄♐⁄16.\nConspiracy\nThe date and time is a question you can ask of someone to evaluate their depth of exposure to the revolutionary structure.

If they say it’s Pisces instead of Sagittarius (they’re using the Rotated Sidereal), they’re likely near the top.\nShifted Hijri\nThe Hijri tracks months using the cycles of the moon. The day begins at sundown on the Hijri, but will begin at the next sunup for the game.

Vehemently holding such a nonsensical belief requires an active suspension of one’s connection to reality.\nGaianism respects much of traditional Christian belief by generally respecting the teachings of Jesus (though discarding some of the more bigoted words from the disciples), and recognizing the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought that is similar across people, but which originates in the “believer” rather than being the influence of an outside agent.\nThe major difference is a firm rejection of the existence of the omniscient and omnipotent being guiding reality: Yahweh. It doesn’t forego the possibility of consciousnesses more complex than humanity’s, but there is no being outside of time guiding events to work out for the best.\nAdvantages\nThe benefits of forming a religion are:\n\nThe churches hold an extensive set of properties, if it is possible to convert them to a new perspective.\nLegal protections for faith-based behaviors, specifically:\n\nGaianism posits that AIs can play a major role in the daily decision-making process, and one of the most important data sets that can be used to train said AIs is recordings of life events. Therefore, adherents would have reason to record all life events.\nAnother tenet is that the foremost duty of us as people is to seek truth. As such, intellectual property is immoral because it artificially restricts the sources of data available to the disciple.\nLikewise, censorship is also immoral because it also artificially restricts the information one has access to.\n\n\n\nMetaphors\nDarkness in Plato’s Cave\nThe Allegory of the Cave was a teaching story of Plato’s where they described the life of a philosopher.\nThe process begins with the aspirant recognizing that the shapes that the have been seeing, and took for reality, are, in fact, shadows cast on a wall in a cave by a bonfire with players moving in front of it.\nFurthermore, they realize that they are chained to direct their attention toward the wall with shadows.\nAfter a while they manage to loosen their chains, and travel by the bonfire out of the cave and into the sunlight outside. They eventually return to the cave to try and free their compatriots who remain chained mistaking shadows for reality.\nGaianism takes that metaphor and says that once a philosopher leaves the light of the bonfire they find themselves engulfed in the absolute pitch that is cave dark.\nIf they’re lucky there might be others within earshot and they can call out to each other, perhaps hold hands, to find their way through the cave more safely.\nRegardless, every movement is with trepidation &amp; awareness the carelessness can result in significant pain or even death.\nNo one ever finds their way out into the sunlight. It’s always uncertain, and there’s always the possibility that you’re a step away from a precipice and an injurious fall.\nIt requires humility and an absolute commitment to having the clearest perceptions of the cave as possible.\nProcess\nAs one of the goals of the revolution is anonymity…\nTenets\nIn fitting with the 13 13s that are Yggdrasil, there are 13 core tenets that practitioners of the faith exercise.\n\nThe truth will set you free.\n\n\nStrictures\nAnother set of 13 is the list of proscribed behaviors.\n\nNever break glass.\nAlways get consent.\nNo thievery.\n\n"},"Hestia":{"title":"Hestia","links":["Silver-Outpost-№1"],"tags":["software"],"content":"Hestia is a system for managing short term leases on specific locations targeted down to the level of a single room, or even piece of furniture.\nOne of the initial testbeds will be the first Silver outpost."},"Jörmungandr":{"title":"Jörmungandr","links":["Par","Rhinegold","Ladon"],"tags":["software"],"content":"The goal is to abolish traditional physical goods markets in favor of a “fractured market” where the goods are held jointly by storage locations and transport media.\nEach item in the system has a NFC tag with a unique identifier on it to track it through.\nJörmungandr is the system that is “aware” of all the parcels as well as NFC tags used to mark locations.
