Annual and holiday events are placed on a rotated 13-sign Sidereal Zodiac. Repeating and supply chain\nevents are on a shifted Islamic lunar Hijri.\nSidereal Zodiac\nThe signs of the Zodiac are determined by which constellation is on the opposite side of the sun from the Earth at any given time. The issue is that the 12-month Zodiac doesn‚Äôt precisely align with the actual positions of the constellations.\nThe Sidereal Zodiac bases the months precisely off the positions of the heavens. It also adds a 13·µó ∞ sign: Ophiuchus ‚Äî the serpent bearer. Month durations vary wildly in the scheme with Scorpio being a mere seven days &amp; Virgo thirty-five.\n\n## Rotated Sidereal Zodiac\nThe system used in Yggdrasil uses a line from the sun through the Earth to determine the month. It is not which stars are opposite the sun from us, but which stars are on the same side. It‚Äôs rotated 180¬∞.\n0‚ÅÑ‚ôë‚ÅÑ0\nCoincidentally, the first day of Capricorn on the Sidereal Zodiac, 0‚ÅÑ‚ôë‚ÅÑ0, is January, 20 on the Gregorian Calendar. Which is also, Inauguration Day for the U.S. President every four years. The date on the revolution‚Äôs calendar, then, is currently counting down to the day a President is inaugurated who has the intention of carrying out the revolution.\nFor example, if we assume the President to follow üçä‚Äôs term will be a revolutionary, today, 2025‚ÅÑ2‚ÅÑ12, would be -3‚ÅÑ‚ôê‚ÅÑ4 meaning that in five days it will be the end of Sagittarius on the Sidereal Zodiac three years out from the fated inauguration.\nThe calendar is zero-based and -3‚ÅÑ‚ôí‚ÅÑ22 (the beginning of the countdown of Aquarius) (i.e. -3‚ÅÑ‚ôê‚ÅÑ0) is 2025‚ÅÑ3‚ÅÑ11 and the month is 23 days long.\nThe countdowns continue until 2029‚ÅÑ1‚ÅÑ20 which, since the flip is when the President is inaugurated and it is also the beginning of Capricorn on a now incrementing calendar, is 0‚ÅÑ‚ôë‚ÅÑ0.\n0‚ÅÑ‚ôê‚ÅÑ16\nTheoretically, üçä could take on an active role in the system &amp; the year zero, then, would have begun 2025‚ÅÑ1‚ÅÑ20. The President of the U.S. is the captain of the Gold Team which represents the existing establishment. It is not infeasible that üçä might claim the title &amp;, if so, it would be all the better for what are initially his co-conspirators who would then have access to the largess of these United States.\nIn that situation, today is 0‚ÅÑ‚ôê‚ÅÑ16.\nConspiracy\nThe date and time is a question you can ask of someone to evaluate their depth of exposure to the revolutionary structure. If they say it‚Äôs 11·¥ò·¥ç in 2025, you know they‚Äôre only professing knowledge of the Gold Team and are likely not in on the secret.\nIf they say it‚Äôs 98 úÕã in the 3 ≥·µà, you know they‚Äôre in pretty deep.

Vehemently holding such a nonsensical belief requires an active suspension of one‚Äôs connection to reality.\nGaianism respects much of traditional Christian belief by generally respecting the teachings of Jesus (though discarding some of the more bigoted words from the disciples), and recognizing the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought that is similar across people, but which originates in the ‚Äúbeliever‚Äù rather than being the influence of an outside agent.\nThe major difference is a firm rejection of the existence of the omniscient and omnipotent being guiding reality: Yahweh. It doesn‚Äôt forego the possibility of consciousnesses more complex than humanity‚Äôs, but there is no being outside of time guiding events to work out for the best.\nAdvantages\nThe benefits of forming a religion are:\n\nThe churches hold an extensive set of properties, if it is possible to convert them to a new perspective.\nLegal protections for faith-based behaviors, specifically:\n\nGaianism posits that AIs can play a major role in the daily decision-making process, and one of the most important data sets that can be used to train said AIs is recordings of life events. Therefore, adherents would have reason to record all life events.\nAnother tenet is that the foremost duty of us as people is to seek truth. As such, intellectual property is immoral because it artificially restricts the sources of data available to the disciple.\nLikewise, censorship is also immoral because it also artificially restricts the information one has access to.\n\n\n\nMetaphors\nDarkness in Plato‚Äôs Cave\nThe Allegory of the Cave was a teaching story of Plato‚Äôs where they described the life of a philosopher.\nThe process begins with the aspirant recognizing that the shapes that the have been seeing, and took for reality, are, in fact, shadows cast on a wall in a cave by a bonfire with players moving in front of it.\nFurthermore, they realize that they are chained to direct their attention toward the wall with shadows.\nAfter a while they manage to loosen their chains, and travel by the bonfire out of the cave and into the sunlight outside. They eventually return to the cave to try and free their compatriots who remain chained mistaking shadows for reality.\nGaianism takes that metaphor and says that once a philosopher leaves the light of the bonfire they find themselves engulfed in the absolute pitch that is cave dark.\nIf they‚Äôre lucky there might be others within earshot and they can call out to each other, perhaps hold hands, to find their way through the cave more safely.\nRegardless, every movement is with trepidation &amp; awareness the carelessness can result in significant pain or even death.\nNo one ever finds their way out into the sunlight. It‚Äôs always uncertain, and there‚Äôs always the possibility that you‚Äôre a step away from a precipice and an injurious fall.\nIt requires humility and an absolute commitment to having the clearest perceptions of the cave as possible.\nProcess\nAs one of the goals of the revolution is anonymity‚Ä¶\nTenets\nIn fitting with the 13 13s that are Yggdrasil, there are 13 core tenets that practitioners of the faith exercise.\n\nThe truth will set you free.\n\n\nStrictures\nAnother set of 13 is the list of proscribed behaviors.\n\nNever break glass.\nAlways get consent.\nNo thievery.\n\n"},"teams/by/logistic/Martyrs‚Äô-Corps":{"title":"Martyrs‚Äô Corps","links":[],"tags":["logistic","planning","politics"],"content":"The Martyr‚Äôs Corps is‚Ä¶"},"teams/by/logistic/Norns":{"title":"Norns","links":[],"tags":["software","aggregation"],"content":"Users will create ordered lists which will be combined to produce new ordered lists personalized for individual users by Skuld, the fate concerned with the future.\nAn important criteria in determining which content to include in a user‚Äôs list is whether they have viewed the piece of content previously &amp; how they reacted to it.

Both acknowledge a set of things given &amp; a set of things received.\nThere should be the possibility of incurring debt to be automatically cryptographically collected upon further sale on down the line. What happens if a collection of parcels is stolen? Dispatch couriers in groups of at least two so that in the case of robbery, there are witnesses to film the encounter. Both for the protection of the couriers, and as protection against false claims of robbery.\nThe question is how precisely the locations of cars &amp; houses can be known by the public. In an ideal world, we could be completely transparent and publish notifications of need to a broadcast network. We would then receive potential contracts from others that help satisfy those needs.\nThere‚Äôs the crucial aspect of privacy though ‚Äî the realistic capacity to pretend to be like others. Knowing what we‚Äôre consuming is problematic. Knowing how everything is getting moved around, however, is not, if the nature of what is being moved is kept secret.\nI want someone in the specialty rock salt market to be able to find a quality supplier of salt, place a bulk order and break that into reasonable serving sizes, along with a lab certification of the substance they are purveying."},"teams/by/software/Hestia":{"title":"Hestia","links":["outpost/Silver-Outpost-‚Ññ1"],"tags":["software"],"content":"Hestia is a system for managing short term leases on specific locations targeted down to the level of a single room, or even piece of furniture.\nOne of the initial testbeds will be the first Silver outpost."},"teams/by/software/J√∂rmungandr":{"title":"J√∂rmungandr","links":["teams/by/software/Par","teams/by/spaces/Rhinegold","teams/by/software/Ladon"],"tags":["software"],"content":"The goal is to abolish traditional physical goods markets in favor of a ‚Äúfractured market‚Äù where the goods are held jointly by storage locations and transport media.\nEach item in the system has a NFC tag with a unique identifier on it to track it through.\nJ√∂rmungandr is the system that is ‚Äúaware‚Äù of all the parcels as well as NFC tags used to mark locations.

Initially, it is simply a set of directory trees which contextualize blobs stored in IPFS.\nUnlike a traditional file system which generally has a single location for a file, the files in M√Ømis are represented by their IPFS CID and will frequently have many directory paths which resolve to a file.\nIdeally, all coherent unique paths which can be used to reference a file will resolve.\nEach user, identified by an Ethereum signature, has their own tree.The trees represent a versioned file system.\nM√Ømis aims to be an enhancement to the existing existing server-based HTTP-driven web.

Also, it will contain information about the relationships between files and how they interrelate.\nUse Cases\nContent Recommendation\nUsers will create ordered lists of content at locations in the directory tree. For example, /meme/funny/capitalism/ might be a list of the funniest memes about capitalism.\nThe rankings aren‚Äôt simply a 1‚Äìn list. For a given rank, there can be more than one entry. Also, it is possible to have zero entries for a given rank.\nThese lists are combined to produce a composite ranking recommending content either through simple weighted averages, or more complex means such as training a neural network.\nView Tracking\nA very important data set in considering which content to provide will be which pieces has the user been presented with in the past &amp; how did they react to them.\nNeo4j is a ‚Äúproperty graph‚Äù which allows storing attributes on nodes and relationships. Eventually, these will be used to track which content has been presented to the user and give them the ability to respond with arbitrary iconography (emojis and images; think Discord).\nResource Conversion\nWhen working with content, it is often the case that the file format used is less than ideal. Documents in PDF rather than something better for responsive layout like HTML or EPUB are a frequent problem.\nM√Ømis will allow publishing of source documents and holding incremental conversions to new formats, allowing multiple contributors to go toward producing a new format.\nCuration\nA current issue facing AI researchers is collecting corpora of high-quality training data.\nM√Ømis will conglomerate collections of training data and make them generally available."},"teams/by/software/Par":{"title":"Par","links":["teams/by/software/Constant-Couriering","Silver-Team"],"tags":["software","couriers"],"content":"Goods and people are constantly being shuttled around by a set of couriering pairs.
