There are at least two systems at play: the dashcam &amp; the coordinator.\nThe dashcam software is recording (potentially livestreaming) their progress &amp; directing their driving.\nWhen a courier gets pulled over, they have no idea what they are carrying. In general packages are sealed in tamper-evident packaging with a NFC-based identifier that can privately prove that it holds a secret key.\nThe coordinator is describing interactions as a series of exchanges of specific parcels at certain points in time. There are always two parties that sign for an exchange. Both acknowledge a set of things given &amp; a set of things received.\nThere should be the possibility of incurring debt to be automatically cryptographically collected upon further sale on down the line. What happens if a collection of parcels is stolen? Dispatch couriers in groups of at least two so that in the case of robbery, there are witnesses to film the encounter. Both for the protection of the couriers, and as protection against false claims of robbery.\nThe question is how precisely the locations of cars &amp; houses can be known by the public. In an ideal world, we could be completely transparent and publish notifications of need to a broadcast network. We would then receive potential contracts from others that help satisfy those needs.\nThere’s the crucial aspect of privacy though — the realistic capacity to pretend to be like others. Knowing what we’re consuming is problematic. Knowing how everything is getting moved around, however, is not, if the nature of what is being moved is kept secret.\nI want someone in the specialty rock salt market to be able to find a quality supplier of salt, place a bulk order and break that into reasonable serving sizes, along with a lab certification of the substance they are purveying."},"Dionysus":{"title":"Dionysus","links":[],"tags":["software"],"content":""},"Drug-War-Horrors":{"title":"Drug War Horrors","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I stand convinced that once the full extent of how much a blight the War on Drugs has been on society, it will be understood to be on par with slavery in terms of the harms it caused.\n\nFormation &amp; militarization of inner-city gangs\n\nDecimation of property values in urban centers\nFostering an environment where delaying gratification is disadvantageous\n\n\nOverdoses arising from inconsistencies in supply\nPrice gouging leading to exorbitant prices driving users to crime\nWild public misconception as to the dangers and effects of various substances.\nThe establishment of authoritarian bureaucracies for control of distribution of substances.\n"},"Gaianism":{"title":"Gaianism","links":["jobs-project","Yggdrasil"],"tags":[],"content":"One of the goals of the revolution is to supplant the Judaistic religions with one grounded in science.\nBasic Cencepts\nOne of the founding tenets of fundamentalist Christianity is that a virgin got pregnant. Vehemently holding such a nonsensical belief requires an active suspension of one’s connection to reality.\nGaianism respects much of traditional Christian belief by generally respecting the teachings of Jesus (though discarding some of the more bigoted words from the disciples), and recognizing the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought that is similar across people, but which originates in the “believer” rather than being the influence of an outside agent.\nThe major difference is a firm rejection of the existence of the omniscient and omnipotent being guiding reality: Yahweh. It doesn’t forego the possibility of consciousnesses more complex than humanity’s, but there is no being outside of time guiding events to work out for the best.\nAdvantages\nThe benefits of forming a religion are:\n\nThe churches hold an extensive set of properties, if it is possible to convert them to a new perspective.\nLegal protections for faith-based behaviors, specifically:\n\nGaianism posits that AIs can play a major role in the daily decision-making process, and one of the most important data sets that can be used to train said AIs is recordings of life events. Therefore, adherents would have reason to record all life events.\nAnother tenet is that the foremost duty of us as people is to seek truth. As such, intellectual property is immoral because it artificially restricts the sources of data available to the disciple.\n\n\n\n\nMetaphors\nDarkness in Plato’s Cave\nThe Allegory of the Cave was a teaching story of Plato’s where they described the life of a philosopher.\nThe process begins with the aspirant recognizing that the shapes that the have been seeing, and took for reality, are, in fact, shadows cast on a wall in a cave by a bonfire with players moving in front of it.\nFurthermore, they realize that they are chained to direct their attention toward the wall with shadows.\nAfter a while they manage to loosen their chains, and travel by the bonfire out of the cave and into the sunlight outside. They eventually return to the cave to try and free their compatriots who remain chained mistaking shadows for reality.\nGaianism takes that metaphor and says that once a philosopher leaves the light of the bonfire they find themselves engulfed in the absolute pitch that is cave dark.\nIf they’re lucky there might be others within earshot and they can call out to each other, perhaps hold hands, to find their way through the cave more safely.\nRegardless, every movement is with trepidation &amp; awareness the carelessness can result in significant pain or even death.\nNo one ever finds their way out into the sunlight. It’s always uncertain, and there’s always the possibility that you’re a step away from a precipice and an injurious fall.\nIt requires humility and an absolute commitment to having the clearest perceptions of the cave as possible.\nProcess\nAs one of the goals of the revolution is anonymity…\nTenets\nIn fitting with the 13 13s that is Yggdrasil, there are 13 core tenets that practitioners of the faith exercise.\n\nThe truth will set you free.\n\n\nStrictures\nAnother set of 13 is the list of proscribed behaviors.\n\nNever break glass.\n\n"},"Helios":{"title":"Helios","links":["Jörmungandr","Pandora","Ladon"],"tags":["software"],"content":"“Half” of the transport system managed by Jörmungandr is a network of drivers moving parcels between holding stations.\nHolding stations may be lockers or human-managed locations."},"Hestia":{"title":"Hestia","links":["Silver-Outpost-№1"],"tags":["software"],"content":"Hestia is a system for managing short term leases on specific locations targeted down to the level of a single room, or even piece of furniture.\nOne of the initial testbeds will be the first Silver outpost."},"Jörmungandr":{"title":"Jörmungandr","links":["Helios"],"tags":["software"],"content":"The goal is to abolish traditional physical goods markets in favor of a “fractured market” where the goods are held jointly by storage locations and transport media.\nEach item in the system has a NFC tag with a unique identifier on it to track it through.\nJörmungandr is the system that is “aware” of all the parcels as well as NFC tags used to mark locations.
