There are at least two systems at play: the dashcam &amp; the coordinator.\nThe dashcam software is recording (potentially livestreaming) their progress &amp; directing their driving.\nWhen a courier gets pulled over, they have no idea what they are carrying. In general packages are sealed in tamper-evident packaging with a NFC-based identifier that can privately prove that it holds a secret key.\nThe coordinator is describing interactions as a series of exchanges of specific parsels at certain points in time. There are always two parties that sign for an exchange.

What happens if a collection of parcels is stolen? Dispatch couriers in groups of at least two so that in the case of robbery, there are witnesses to film the encounter. Both for the protection of the couriers, and as protection against false claims of robbery.\nThe question is how precisely the locations of cars &amp; houses can be known by the public. In an ideal world, we could be completely transparent and publish notifications of need to a broadcast network. We would then receive potential contracts from others that help satisfy those needs.\nThere’s the crucial aspect of privacy though — the realistic capacity to pretend to be like others. Knowing what we’re consuming is problematic. Knowing how everything is getting moved around, however, is not, if the nature of what is being moved is kept secret.\nI want someone in the specialty rock salt market to be able to find a quality supplier of salt, place a bulk order and break that into reasonable serving sizes, along with a lab certification of the substance they are purveying."},"Drug-War-Horrors":{"title":"Drug War Horrors","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I stand convinced that once the full extent of how much a blight the War on Drugs has been on society, it will be understood to be on par with slavery in terms of the harms it caused.\n• Formation &amp; militarization of inner-city gangs\n• Overdoses arising from inconsistencies in supply\n• Price gouging leading to exorbitant prices driving users to crime\n• Wild public misconception as to the dangers and effects of various substances.\n\nThe establishment of authoritarian bureaucracies for control of distribution of substances.\n"},"Mammon":{"title":"Mammon","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Mammon is concerned with the compensation for resources.
