The 13 13s is part of the augmented reality game Yggdrasil. There are 13 axes each with 13 elements. There are 13 teams, each of which is mapped to one element on each axis.

There are 13 tokens and 13 essential needs. The token is supposed to exchange very favorably for its associated need. Food, for instance, is really cheap in orange tokens, and shelter in brown.

Two of the needs, Substances and Sex, put the game at potential odds with law enforcement. The other teams, of which the existing establishment is one, coordinate to help back credible retaliatory threats.

Law enforcement officers will receive gold tokens in addition to any others they might hold, so a black cop will self-identify.
