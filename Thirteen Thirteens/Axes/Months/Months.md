The 13 months of the scientifically accurate Zodiac are used to delineate a social calendar:

- ♑: Capricorn: <1/21 - 2/16>
- ♒: Aquarius: <2/16 - 3/11>
- ♓: Pisces: <3/11 - 4/18>
- ♈: Aries: <4/18 - 5/13>
- ♉: Taurus: <5/13 - 6/21>
- ♊: Gemini: <6/21 - 7/20>
- ♋: Cancer: <7/20 - 8/10>
- ♌: Leo: <8/10 - 9/16>
- ♍: Virgo: <9/16 - 10/30>
- ♎: Libra: <10/30 - 11/23>
- ♏: Scorpio: <11/23 - 11/29>
- ⛎: Ophiuchus: <11/29 - 12/27>
- ♐: Sagittarius: <12/27 - 1/20>

The 13-sign zodiac is the scientifically accurate representation of the position of the constellations relative to the plane of the elliptic.

Coincidentally, the 0ᵗʰ day of Capricorn (the calendar is zero-indexed with 100 minute hours and hundred second minutes) falls on January 20ᵗʰ, the Inauguration of the President of the U.S.A..

The 0ᵗʰ year then is taken to be the start of the Revolution. It can either be Joe Biden if he joins the game, or it can be his successor.

Personally, I am counting this year a pessimistic -5 with six remaining to real change.

Were Biden to manage to pull off being President of Zero, he would naturally serve two terms leaving on 3/♑︎/0.
