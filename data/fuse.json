In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.\n* One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn & rock salt.

If I choose to write in a candidate instead of voting for a Democrat or Republican nominee, it is my right because I built this country with my blood, sweat, and tears.\n> \n> We owe democracy nothing. The weakest parts of our Constitution were intentionally designed to appease those dedicated to protecting the institution of slavery. The lack of a popular vote was a direct result of slave states' opposition, ensuring that the voices of enslaved African Americans were systematically silenced. The strongest advocates for a weak central government were the biggest beneficiaries of slavery, shaping the nation’s foundations to serve their interests. If democracy is weak, blame the flesh peddlers like the reprehensible Thomas Jefferson. Blame James Madison, Charles Pinckney, and George Washington.

This was shortly before I fully committed to diving down the rabbit hole & dashed my life to pieces on the shoals of grandiose thinking. My modus operandi at that point in time was very much Spirit driven. I distrusted my analytic perspective on things because, as I was apt to think then, \"this fire has never burned before\". I.e. that the coming social change was something akin to the collapse of an energy field in physics. That bunches of exponential processes would be feeding off each other and producing excesses to fuel rapid social change. I didn't know what it was going to look like, but I knew it was going to happen, and the best way to bring it about was to try and keep my thoughts and motivations Spirit-driven. :ghost~1:\n\nAt that point in time I was already well-past a literal belief in the Bible, and the idea of a being that existed outside of time and was guiding everything. :map:\n\nI thought perhaps though God was some sort of omnipresent energy that we can attune ourselves to and in doing so coordinate better. Or, alternatively, that there was nothing other than the mode of cognition. A type perhaps associated with Ken Wilber's Worldcentric mode of through, or Kohlberg's Postconventional thought — something more advanced than the traditional analytic or emotional modes. In either case, something phenomenonically perceptible. I could *feel* the Spirit and, with practice, find it easier to *be* that way more consistently. :mosque::church::synagogue:\n\nThe big problem was my lack of experience in trying to change people's minds, and some wildly inaccurate expectations arose as a result. I thought I was going to hit it big & start preaching to the masses in a matter of weeks or months. I thought I mostly made sense & all I had to do was iron out the wrinkles. It's now nine years later & I'm only about 20% of the way done with what I think is my most coherent & actionable plan to date: [[root|a Dendron notebook describing the story]]. :movie_camera:\n\nMy motivations at this point are ironically pretty much the same as yours: wanting your all's spiritual development. I believe that there are commonalities in our experiences of being Spirit-driven and that those are real and meaningful. That, unfortunately, we all grew up in a culture where those experiences are attributed to the intervention of an outside being: Yahweh. For better or worse though, there's nobody minding the store but us. There's nothing omniscient guiding the passage of history. We are all there is to take the reigns & the responsibility for shepherding the planet. :ram:\n\nI think Burr makes some really good points in this bit: [Bill Burr on Religion](https://youtu.be/UrVCvnJk4go?t=133).

That which is holy is doing that which benefits the health of God, bearing in mind that each one of us is an aspect of the totality of all life. Orgasming, then, is taken as a sacred act of adding some bliss to the Godhead.\n>\n> The act of masturbating requires one to focus on the manual processes of stimulation and, oftentimes, detracts from the depth of the experience. “Worshiping” with a Gaianist could involve getting (or giving) a gloved hand-job (potentially with toys).\n>\n> If the risk of disease can be reduced to near zero, then the only issue at hand is the near universal disquiet most people experience when it comes to expressing sensuality. I want to create networks of health attestations (including lab tests) such that people can chose the extent of a sexual interaction (and choose partners) while minimizing illness.\n>\n> This also impacts the building of the Black & White teams that are the \"illegal teams\" attempting to satisfy needs for sex & substances. I heard a rumor that if someone accuses you of being a cop, you can either take off all your clothes or punch them in the face: cops aren't allowed to do either. Honestly, that sounds spurrious to me, but if their process of infiltrating the organization involves giving and receiving recorded sexual favors, it may give some level of protection.\n>\n> A big part of wanting to be a religion is the legal protections it incurs. I need a page with a good overview of the 13-13s with the ability to enroll as a Gaianist. Hmm, I'm looking at the internet on certified religious organizations in the U.S. & it says:\n>\n> > * the organization must organize and operate exclusively for the pursuit of one or more charitable purposes recognized by the IRS;\n> > * the organization’s net earnings must not serve to enrich private individuals or shareholders (beyond reasonable compensation for services rendered);\n> > * lobbying cannot make up a substantial part of the organization’s activities;\n> > * the organization cannot intervene in political campaigns; and\n> > * the organization’s purpose and actions cannot be illegal or violate fundamental public policy.\n>\n> It's those last two that are a problem.

Every organism is a part of the Godhead, and more complex composite aspects are formed by interactions between organisms.\n\n## The Fall of Christianity\n\nThe primary tool to dismantle Christianity is to press on the concept of the virgin birth. To ask believers if they genuinely believe a virgin got pregnant, and then how they know that their experience of the Spirit originates outside their head.\n\nConceptually, the Christians we are looking to convert are relying on Social Proof to determine their beliefs. They look to their family and community to evaluate their structures. If an influential portion of the population *(some of whom could be existing atheists)* supports the position, it could shift things like a tide.\n\n## The Caliphate\n\nFor the leader of the church to be the primary political leader is the Islamic end-of-days myth called the Caliphate after the Caliph: the person who heads the church that unifies the world.\n\nThat is what I would like my historical footprint to be. To found the church that unifies the world.\n\nThe crux is to respect the existence of the Spirit, and the reality of it as a mode of being. To have a society where being Spirit-lead is respected and encouraged, is definitely part of the goal, and so the concept of a Caliphate fits in several ways.\n\n\n## Softwares\n\nThe Gaiainist church believes that several pieces of software can be created to aid in the lessening of human suffering.\n\n* **Mïmïs**: Is an append-only versioned document store where the primitives include DOM nodes. Backed by IPFS and Neo4j, Mïmïs gives each user their own versioned graph and makes it easy to sync potions of that graph to other accounts.

Participants receive a base payment for being present for a session and recording a video. That compensation, however, can be more than doubled based on peer review of the session stream.\n\nThe goal is to provide a resource for architects who have a reasonably well structured project description, but don't have the resources to build a development organization. Also, the recordings will capture the entire development process for the program, and, when combined with the review metadata should provide interested parties a live \"blame\" view of the author's thinking for each piece of code.\n\n## Interfaces\n\nThere are four primary interfaces used to orchestrate the endeavor:\n\n* [Scheduling](#scheduling)\n* [Transition](#transition)\n* [Execution](#execution)\n* [Review](#review)\n\n### Scheduling\n\nA session has at least three participants: the Navigator, the Driver, and a Witness. The Navigator described the code to be written while the Driver operates the keyboard.\n\nNavigators apply for sessions by providing:\n\n* a minimum hourly rate they will accept\n* the time slot they desire; because the time is dependant on the session before, they specify what they want as:\n  * a minimum start time\n  * a maximum end time\n  * a minimum duration\n  * a preferred duration\n  * a maximum duration\n* a set of GitHub issues they intend to address\n* a set of tasks they expect to accomplish\n\nMembers of a planning circle maintain a GitHub project to rank issues and tasks so that would be Navigators know what to prioritize.\n\n#### Scheduling Incentives\n\nThe expected minimum pay is $15 / hour for everyone with bonuses based on the result of the evaluation of the recording.\n\n### Transition\n\nThe basic process is a repetition of:\n\n* Mob Working\n* Mob Coordinating\n* Mob Transitioning\n\nWhere “Mob Transitioning” is a change of Navigator. For any given mob, there is a *“Navigator”*. The Navigator runs the call & is the ultimate authority when it comes to the direction of the mob. Depending on the relative skillsets, the Navigator may be dictating the majority of the code.\n\nThe mechanics of operating the machinery of the computer falls to the *“Driver”*. Under the instruction of the rest of the mob they manage files and their contents, and run whatever tests are desired.\n\nThere's at least three people in a mob, and the *“Witness”* rounds out the basic three. The Witness has [software they use to evaluate the call](https://pairs.trwb.live).\n\nAny of the three positions in the mob can swap out…\n\nDuring the hour of overlap the incoming pair will get a stream key for the Driver to configure OBS on their system. The viewing key will be encrypted using Lit & made accessible to appropriate token and address holders.\n\nAll participants in the call are encouraged to record in case there's some issue with the Driver's stream.\n\nCalls take place via a Discord video chat that has a bot bouncer limiting access to holders of specific addresses and tokens.\n\nThe two pairs use the overlapping hour for the departing team to summarize their accomplishments & any outstanding tasks. Based on this feedback the coming pair may choose to alter the tasks they play to address.\n\nEventually, the leaving pair makes a final commit and control passes to the new team.\n\n### Execution\n\nA major component of compensation is based on input from a program that semantically breaks down the video into time periods of activities like debugging or new development or testing.\n\nPeriods when the pair goes off track are marked as well as events like discovering a solution and writing code that doesn't conform to the syntax standards.\n\nDuring their session the participants have access to this review interface to create a first pass at marking the recording in real time.\n\n### Review\n\nOne of the dangers of this system is that the development pair will accidentally reveal secret information to the stream that will be used by an attacker to perform an exploit.\n\nTo avoid this, until the video has undergone a set of trusted full reviews where the interface allows the flagging for blurring of secret data review will be limited to sets of token holders.\n\nAs well as an objective description of the events, reviewers are also able to make subjective assessments: both descriptive statements and also weighted terms. It will also be possible to review reviews and rate the veracity of an assessment.\n\n#### Incentives\n\nThe pair of programmers receive a fixed rate that is moderated by the reviews of their session.\n\nThe initial three reviewers will earn at the same rate as the other participants. In general the idea is we are buying people's time and that is worth roughly the same amount *(~$15⁄hr)* regardless of whose time it is.\n\nAfter the initial reviews, compensation will be for establishing consensus on the evaluation of the video. Adding annotations that weren't present previously & are voted meaningful by a quorum of voters will be rewarded.\n\n## Technologies\n\n* [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) will be used for steaming the sessions & capturing recordings.\n* [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network) will be used for storing review information.\n* The FVM will be used for token-based accomplishment tracking and permissions using [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org).\n* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) will be used for the storage of video streams.\n* Postgresql will be used for querying bids to determine potential schedules.\n","n":0.033}}},{"i":102,"$":{"0":{"v":"The New Black Market","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"We don't supplant the gangs.

Shops can be token-gated, but the metadata for a token also contains information about how to sync with that shop's state.\n\nWhen items are sold the buyer is responsible for creating a delivery plan.\n\nItems are stored relative to waypoints in terms of time. Rather than sharing with the system the exact storage location of something, its location will be \"within *x* minutes of *y*\". When on the job, Couriers will describe their location using the same nomenclature.\n\nThe system will generate recommended series of holders and couriers which span the distance from the items waypoint to the customer. The buyer will choose from these options based desires for cost and speed.\n\nEach item in the system is uniquely identified within the system. A sales contract for a generic item will be for one from a set of potentials.\n\nHolders are responsible for maintaining storage locations. A holder might give over a room in their house to the system. They could adjust their contracts so that items they use regularly are part of what is stored at their site. When they have need of more of a product, they contact the seller and buy directly from what is already onsite.\n\nItems are protected through a combination of escrows, bonds, and reputation.\n\nThe process begins when a distributor receives in bulk from a supplier. The distributor divides and packages the bulk receipt. They then create representations of the items in their shop, coordinate that with a NFC tag on the item, and sync that data to the network.\n\nPackages exist within the system solely in terms of their physical characteristics, their waypoint-based location, & a unique tracking identifier.\n\nOutside parties will be given the capacity to make verifiably authentic claims about items or collections of items within the network. Say for instance someone is buying insulin through the network, a sample of the product can be sent to a testing lab in such a way the lab can make available to someone viewing the product the results of the tests.\n\nTaking possession of an item will involve scanning its NFC tag and signalling a to the network a change of control.\n","n":0.051}}},{"i":103,"$":{"0":{"v":"Existing","n":1},"1":{"v":"Thirteen existing projects will be aided using [[Serial Mobbing]]:\n* Veilid\n* Dendron\n* SourceCred\n* Open Broadcaster Studio\n* Blender\n* Inkscape\n* Firefox\n* Wikipedia\n* IPFS\n* SciHub\n* Git\n* Linux\n* Google opening everything they have in exchange for permission to be a monopoly.","n":0.167}}},{"i":104,"$":{"0":{"v":"Duos","n":1},"1":{"v":"There are pairs of people driving around in cars and staffing shifts at holding locations.
