The Silver team is responsible for [[rules|13-13s.rules]] enforcement. Rules are determined by the [[holders of spaces|13-13s.axes.spaces]]. Silver exists to enforce those rules. If someone has another player in their space and wants them removed for any reason, and that party refuses to leave, that's Silver's responsibility.

Silver is meant to have the real threat of physical violence to back its direction. Dangerousness is determined by capturing recordings of combat & ranking the relative dangeousness of the combatants. When necessary, Silver should be able to muster teams capable to genuine physical threat.

If someone is being removed to an area, they may be kept under control for as long as it takes to move them to an area where they have permission to be. That area will be determined by the holders of the various areas in combination. It will be determined as a combination of available space, ability to pay rent, previous transgressions, and consumer preferences.
