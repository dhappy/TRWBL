<p>PSA:  👑🤴🏿 📢📢</p>
<p>This is a friendly reminder that as an African American, I don't owe any political party my vote. It's essential to recognize that Black people don't owe democracy; instead, democracy owes Black people. This country was called a democracy even when my ancestors were enslaved, and our flesh bought and sold. If I choose to write in a candidate instead of voting for a Democrat or Republican nominee, it is my right because I built this country with my blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
<p>We owe democracy nothing. The weakest parts of our Constitution were intentionally designed to appease those dedicated to protecting the institution of slavery. The lack of a popular vote was a direct result of slave states' opposition, ensuring that the voices of enslaved African Americans were systematically silenced. The strongest advocates for a weak central government were the biggest beneficiaries of slavery, shaping the nation’s foundations to serve their interests. If democracy is weak, blame the flesh peddlers like the reprehensible Thomas Jefferson. Blame James Madison, Charles Pinckney, and George Washington. Don't blame the man who lost his connection to his Nigerian roots in the Yoruba tribe to pick cotton and tobacco in Kershaw, South Carolina for the sake of your precious democracy.</p>
<p>As Juneteenth nears, it’s crucial to remember that my people can do with their vote whatever we please because no one owns us anymore!</p>
<p>The fight for our freedom and equality has been long and arduous, but it has also been a testament to our strength and resilience. We exercise our right to vote in whatever manner we see fit, not as a favor to democracy, but as a declaration of our autonomy and power.</p>
<p>As I have the honor to be your obedient servant,</p>

<p>A big part of my dream for the future is to create an electronically verifiable organization for Black people where Blackness is determined by the community. (𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘉𝘭𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘮 𝘪𝘴 𝘰𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯, 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦'𝘴 12 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘱𝘴 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 𝘴𝘦𝘨𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘴𝘰𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘵𝘺.)</p>
<p>There's a new branch of computer science called "zero knowledge proofs" that allow creating an org where membership is required to vote, but no one can tell if a particular account is a member or not. So, membership is truly anonymous &#x26; unless you purposefully reveal your participation, it can be hidden.</p>
<p>I want the Black team to require a greater than ⅗ of voters agreeing that a particular account holder is Black or not. I also want to have a direct democracyesque feature where you can allow people to vote on your behalf, but always with the ability override that vote if desired.</p>
<p>What I'd do once I was able to easily target genuinely Black people is use them as the backbone of a revised substances Agorist market. It would serve both recreational and medicinal substances, provide safety by introducing a laboratory testing step between production and distribution, &#x26; eliminate violence through the use of a blind courier system.</p>
<p>The vast majority of overdoses caused by the demon Fentanyl &#x26; it's ilk aren't from the inherent dangerousness of the drug, but from it being introduced where it wasn't expected or someone intentionally consumes it, but gets an unexpectedly high dose because the current drug supply chain is erratic in purity.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical and illicit markets are worth billions if not more. I'd take that money and give alot of it to an AI that has a model of the world and all the people in it. It'd have the ability to subsidize events that it recommends to its users with the initial goal of raising the base standard of living to where no one fears for a lack of shelter or food.</p>
<p>Once hunger and homelessness are sorted worldwide, I think it'll be increasingly difficult to convince people to pick up guns and head off to war. Once war is sorted, we'd get the defense budget back &#x26; essentially double our available funds. The world'd never be the same.</p>
<p>Were I to have my druthers, I'd replace Harris on the 2024 Biden ticket, and once elected VP, I'd livestream the entire execution of my office through a medium that allows the public to participate.</p>
