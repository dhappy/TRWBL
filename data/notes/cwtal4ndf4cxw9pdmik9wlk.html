<p><em>(This is an aspect of the system that's been a part of it for a while, but when I try to define it it feels flat in a way that most of the rest do not, so I'm not sure this should remain.)</em></p>
<p>The thirteen teams are separated into three alliances: red, blue, and purple.</p>
<p>Red and blue are three teams apiece, and those alliances are to be headed by XX women and XY men. The remaining seven purple teams can be anyone.</p>
<p>The reason for having a genetic basis for these alliances is to codify as one of the basic conflicts the war of the sexes.</p>
<p>Given 100 men and 100 women, if you lose 90 women there will likely be bloodshed in the competition for the remaining ten. If you lose 90 men, anyone who wants to get pregnant still can. Metaphorically, men are the dice and women the board. <em>(The higher variability of traits in men speaks ot this as well.)</em></p>
<p>The goal with having sexed alliances is, since <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">Yggdrasil (Private)</a> is about control of space, to give control of space to women.</p>
