<h1 id="duos">Duos<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#duos"></a></h1>
<p>There are pairs of people driving around in cars and staffing shifts at holding locations. There are a variety of functions these pairs can be performing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver / Courier: delivering parcels to buyers</li>
<li>Gunman / Cameraman: confronting rule breakers</li>
<li>Driver / Clerk: providing access to the in-vehicle inventory</li>
<li>Holder / Check: providing access to a stationary inventory</li>
<li>Guards: accompanying another duo to provide additional security</li>
<li>Driver / Navigator: hacking: running an unlicensed taxi: a hack</li>
<li>Regional Manager / Dispatcher / Property Manager: taking a request for aid of some form</li>
<li>Force / Dispatcher / Human: taking a request for aid with physical security</li>
<li>Provisioneer / Dispatcher / Consumer: taking a request for material aid</li>
<li>Dispatcher / Player: taking a request for rules enforcement</li>
<li>Distri*t / Party: representing the conglomeration of a group of related parties where parties may themselves be conglomerations</li>
<li>Distrikt / Distriqt: Distri*ts contain themselves</li>
<li>Polis / District: a combination of multiple districts</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important in category theory that for category theory to apply, certain properties had to hold true.</p>
<p>If a gunman sees the offending party to put their finger on the trigger, if they obviously comprehend trigger discipline, as permission to try and shoot their hand off. Where the initial shots from gunman are nonlethal.</p>
<p>I mostly just need lots and lots of money to pay programmers.</p>
