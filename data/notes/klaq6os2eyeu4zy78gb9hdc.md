_TRWBL_ is a near-term science fiction story describing the progression from the world of today to a future without homelessness, hunger, or war.

If such a narrative could be made sufficiently convincing, people might be convinced to participate in the initial steps outlined for bringing the plan to fruition.

The main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called [[13-13s]].
