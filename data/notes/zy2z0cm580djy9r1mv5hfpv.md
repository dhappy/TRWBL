This is an idea for an event facilitation program.

1. An Owner maps a site and designates availability
1. A Host selects the site and time period they would like to reserve
1. A Host invites Guests to pick spaces for the duration
1. Guests make reservations for spaces
1. Guests specify substances they are interested in
1. Dealers can see all the users desires and can make bids for a house
1. Guests view bids and make specific purchasing requests
1. Some set of bids are accepted
1. Dealers individually seal each of the orders and mail it to the Collector
1. The Collector conglomerates all the packages into one parcel
1. The Bootlegger picks up the parcel, divides the orders into combination locked bags with a printed nfc card in the lock
	* The front of the nfc card is artwork provided by the Guests
	* The back of the nfc card is a QR code
	* The value of the nfc card is a url that returns the value of the QR code
	* There is a pouch on the bag such that the back of the card cannot be viewed without removing the lock
1. A piece of paper with the Guests alias is placed in the pouch along with the card
1. The bags are delivered to the site
1. The bags are distributed to rooms according to reservations
1. The Guest receives the bag
1. The QR code contains a link to get the combination of the locked
1. They authenticate to the app and confirm receipt
