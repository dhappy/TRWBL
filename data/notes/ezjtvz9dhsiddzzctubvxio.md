> A flea market with 169 stalls (13 teams with 13 stalls apiece) where the contents of each have been decided upon by a collaborative process.
>
> It should be the most interesting and useful things laid out in a map that is certifiable art. Something taking tens of thousands of hours from tens of thousands of people.
>
> We run some algorithm for the initial distribution of space & then allow trading. The base unit is the stall which is 1⁄169ᵗʰ of the available space.
>
> "Road" & "parking" spaces factor into the total.
>
> Maybe they should be offered at a discount because there are conditions on their use.
>
> The supplies in the market are provided by backers who expect a reward for fronting the money. Currently, in the drug market, it's 300% for customers, 200% for friends & family.
