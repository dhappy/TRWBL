To get briefly political, I believe that the War on Drugs and what it has done to militarize the gangs that control our inner-cities will eventually be recognized as a societal ill on par with slavery.

I think that crypo enables us to create new avenues for people to reliably procure substances without the fear of violence.

They talk about the overdose epidemic, but the primary cause is the uncertainty about the quality of the supply. Dealers "step on" their products introducing "cuts" that mimic the substance, but are substantially cheaper. Except not everyone steps on their product as hard, and when dealing with substances as dangerous as Fentanyl, getting an unexpectedly strong dose can be the difference between life and death.

People are not overdosing because they're inexperienced or careless. They don't know what they're getting.

My plan is to introduce mass spectrometer & other testing between production and distribution with the test results available to the end consumer. Also, I want to use a blind courier service for delivery, and structure a market where violence is both futile and counterproductive.

I'm currently working on a simple token-gated store using [Hats Protocol](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/146), Lit Protocol, & NFC tags.

I got my hands on a few ounces of THCa which is legal in most of these 50 states, but which becomes Î”-9 THC when vaporized, & I've been prototyping packaging & NFC interactions.

*([ARX](https://arx.org) has some amazing chips that hold a secret key secret by only providing signatures of nonces. Unfortunately, the only phones I've found that'll read them are a Pixel 6 & Flip 4. A myriad of other devices have failed, and at this point I have neither the social capital to get people to change devices nor the financial capital to provide them with them.)*

All this is organized in terms of an augmented reality game called [Yggdrasil](https://ygg.army/). *(Not the greatest landing page, I know. I'm in the process of dumping as much of the narrartive as I can manage [into a Dendron notebook](https://notes.trwb.live)*.

Yggdrasil is itself ultimately an aspect of a speculative science-fiction story about the transition from our reality to a world without homelessness, hunger, or war: _The Technoanarchist Revolution_.
