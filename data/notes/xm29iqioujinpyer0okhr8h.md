The game is about changing the rules about how space is allocated such that no one has to sleep outside and on average a much higher percentage of people are very satisfied by their housing accommodations.

The land comes from several sources:

* established ecovillages
* converted churches
* converted banks
* purchased plots

Once a space is entered into the system, it can be held by a player.

A hold may be in the future. Holds are subject to revision up to half a lunar cycle before they're to be executed. At that point they are fixed and the holder can make concrete plans for their stay.

Stays are for relatively short periods — less than a lunar month — and players are constantly moving around the board.

The system knows which amenities and tools the user prefers and works to make sure they're either readily or shortly available.
