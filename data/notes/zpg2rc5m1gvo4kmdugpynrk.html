<p>The Gold Team is the establishment, specifically the US government, the rest of the world's governments are the <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">#🐽︱pink︱🐽 (Private)</a> team.</p>
<p>The captain of the Gold Team is the President.</p>
<p>One of my pipe dreams is I could take the Presidency &#x26; for a period have the combined power of two of the 13 teams to try and accomplish my machinations.</p>
<p>The timeline where this happens, Joe Biden gives me temporary control of an aircraft carrier :ship: in exchange for a timeline where he serves two terms.</p>
<p>I spend those five years as a very small town mayor who live-streams the entirety of the execution of my office with interfaces to let the public interact with the situations I'm in.</p>
<p>After those five, I get to be the last President of the United States &#x26; in my eight years slowly transition the world to a post-scarcity Technoanarchist utopia.</p>
<p>Most of the point of all of this is about control of space. I want to cede portions of the United States to twelve other jursidictions and rules enforcement systems.</p>
<p>I want there to be three alliances: Red, Blue, and Purple. They are XX women, XY men, and whatever else people are as the third. They control three teams, three teams, and seven teams respectively.</p>
<p>I pissed off <a title="Private" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank" class="private">@Heterotic (Private)</a> years ago saying that I wanted to reserve teams for genetically determined sexes, not understanding I was planning to take the lion’s share for the rest of us.</p>
