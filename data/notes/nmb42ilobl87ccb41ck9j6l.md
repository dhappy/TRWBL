Different time keeping metrics will be used for different purposes.

The primary scheduling clock is the 13-sign zodiac, but its months vary widely in duration, so it isn't useful for tracking something needing regularity like the functioning of a business. For that, we will align the cycles of business to the moon as delineated by the Islamic Hijri.

The [primary clock](https://z13cdn.web.app) is a decimal one with 10 hours per day, 100 minutes per hour, & 100 seconds per minute. The time on this clock is essentially the percent of the day that is done.
