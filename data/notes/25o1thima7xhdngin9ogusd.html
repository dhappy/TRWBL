<p>Stay is the core of the purpose of Yggdrasil which is to change how people are given access to space. When combined with <a href="/notes/2gc6e09zgfaqf4bpe2c6l0x">Stuff</a> it will operate to make people de facto rich.</p>
<p>Being rich isn't about having alot of money. Being rich is about having access. Access to resources be they consumable or rare or whatever. What money <em>allows</em> the rich to do is to have what they want.</p>
<p>I want to start a campaign to incorporate properties into the game. Through a combination of amelioration and reducing unused desirable space we should be able to give a larger percentage of the population access to places they want to be.</p>
<p>There need to be 3D models of the spaces. Users can tell by coloration where they have rights.</p>
<p>Part of what the <a href="/notes/btzu3ymifbepie8aqx16gaq">Duos</a> are doing is delivering the possessions of Guests</p>
