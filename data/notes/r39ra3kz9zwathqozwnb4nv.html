<p>My idea for a hard social reset would be to record the development of a massive conspiracy.</p>
<p>The operation of the conspiracy is intertwined with everyday life, but given an alternate explanation in the work-a-day world.</p>

<p>Guides will use stickers <em>(often covering Ed25519-producing NFC tags)</em> placed in public places to locate events &#x26; materials within the goods network.</p>

<p>An open question for me is what details need to be kept secret. It is theoretically possible that the existence of a conspiracy is known publicly, but it could still operate using hidden mechanisms and protect its operations.</p>
