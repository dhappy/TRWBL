<blockquote>
<p>A flea market with 169 stalls (13 teams with 13 stalls apiece) where the contents of each have been decided upon by a collaborative process.</p>
<p>It should be the most interesting and useful things laid out in a map that is certifiable art. Something taking tens of thousands of hours from tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>We run some algorithm for the initial distribution of space &#x26; then allow trading. The base unit is the stall which is 1‚ÅÑ169·µó ∞ of the available space.</p>
<p>"Road" &#x26; "parking" spaces factor into the total.</p>
<p>Maybe they should be offered at a discount because there are conditions on their use.</p>
<p>The supplies in the market are provided by backers who expect a reward for fronting the money. Currently, in the drug market, it's 300% for customers, 200% for friends &#x26; family.</p>
