<p>The heart of the operation is sets of partners riding around in vehicles.</p>
<p>They serve a variety of purposes, the first is as a dispatch. There are several services provided by the network: parcel delivery, cameraperson, security, ridesharing, sales from an in-vehicle inventory.</p>
<p>Triage is partially automated and routes calls to active cars. The non-driving partner in unoccupied cars collaborate to provide voice support.</p>
<p>Getting as much as possible uploaded to the cloud and accessible is one of the primary foci.</p>
<p>I want a driver to hit a button on their phone, it connects them to someone who organizes the response with the ability to tune others into the livestream.</p>
<p>I think in terms of specific situations that come up in the story: The Technoanarchist Revolution.</p>
<p>The Revolution is funded initially by cleaning up the black market for drugs. Hackers provide a cleaner, cheaper, &#x26; safer distribution network with voluntary percentages going back into the organization.</p>
<p>One place where I imagine someone hitting the call button is they're delivering parcels and they get pulled over.</p>
<p>There is a dashcam app recording the drive locally. When the call goes in the responder gets a view and has the option to escalate the call. I'd like there to be legal advice available as well as the ability to call in a third party camera crew.</p>
<p>What to replace the police with is a complex question, but the initial tack is to simply swarm an area with camerapeople.</p>
<p>I'd also like to figure out how to correlate the holding of a cryptocurrency with firearm-free physical dangerousness. Something like have recorded dojo fights which award cryptocurrency to the combatants.</p>
<p>The question of how armed the teams should be, and I think the solution is to have a variety with a very well known escalation guildline to not introduce guns into situations where they are not present.</p>
