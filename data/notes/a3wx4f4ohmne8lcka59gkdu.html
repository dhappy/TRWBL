<p>Anyone can enter items into the system and they needn't ship them anywhere. The transport from the current location to the buyer is organized by the buyer as part of the purchase.</p>
<p>Parcel transfers use the scanning of NFC tags and the transfer of NFTs to track ownership.</p>
<p>Parcels may be conglomerated and locked into bundles, say, for instance, a backpack with have a dozen smaller items in it locked closed. The system will have a concept of such a configuration.</p>
<p>There should be systems with overarching views of the location of all the Couriers and Holders and Parcels. These systems will suggest to Buyers shipping paths for them to take possession of what they've bought.</p>
<p>For many transactions the seller will give the courier a locked reusable shipping pouch. The courier delivers blind and the recipient gets the lock combination directly from the seller.</p>
