> > It is a collaborative filesystem stored in a graph database. Each user has their own system represented in the database and we then compose those trees to produce listings and resources. It'll look alot like what browsers of large amounts of images look like currently: *(see attachment)*.
> >
> > There will be several fundamental differences not the least of which is images can represent single resources or collections. Browsing into a collection will give you a new set of images.
> >
> > On a collaborative filesystem, I want for artists to publish the source files for their works so that collaboration can be as easy as possible.
> >
> > The version control software Git uses a blockchain like structure where each commit refers to the commit before, and you can chain back through them to eventually get the entire history. That tree-like structure is easily representable in Neo4j, so having resources and collections all be versioned should be doable.
> >
> > Ultimately, the goal is to build a system that never loses information, sort of like the Arweave. Once data goes in, it sticks. The collection can only grow. So, if 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 was immensely popular for a long period of time, it could become the de facto standard for how data is stored.

> > Every time you save a file a new version is created, capturing a granular picture of the processes of creating digital works.

> > Neo4j can also run in a Docker container & they have an only slightly handicapped Community Edition that's open. I'm currently using the cloud to hold the database, but there's a not too complicated alternative version where every node and edge in the database is identified by a UUID, and it can run on people's home machines.

> > This enables distributing videos reliably that don't abide by copyright law and use whatever song or video they think is best for an occasion rather than what copyright law will allow. I think it could be a platform for a new breed of artists who can sample the Zeitgeist as liberally as they want without fear of censorship or censure.
> >
> > I get that the black market pitch is too risky for reasonable people. How about a censorship-resistant video distribution platform built on a collaborative filesystem?
> >
> > I want to generate a single giant graph for every save of every file saved. It'll be huge, but, apparently you can have Aura *(Neo4j's cloud service)* to throw TiBs of RAM & disk at it, and it'll scale up.

> > So, in my game of 13 13s, one of the thirteens is thirteen software projects. 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰 is one of them. I want for them to run 24 hours a day. I want people to bid on a subsequent series pair programming session times where one team passes the torch to another pair at the end of their time. The 13 projects are:
> >
> > ⎔ Courier: A vehicle coordination interface coordinating the movements of driver / co-pilot pairs as they deliver goods and people. [ship.via.autos](https://ship.via.autos)
> > ⬢ 𝔐𝔦̈𝔪𝔦𝔰: A versioned collaborative filesystem. [mimisb.run](https://mimisb.run)
> > ⬡ Consult: A system for managing a series of chained pair programming sessions and to collect peer review of the work quality. If I have a fundraising goal at this point it is two weeks 24-hours a day of development on this project.
> > ⬦ Pythia: A relevant statistic generator that records life decisions and polls to determine sentiment after the fact. I might be considering taking mushrooms & Pythia tells me that there's a 95±8% chance that I'll think this was a good thing to have done in five years.
> > ⬥ Where: An event recommendation engine. A collaborative calendar that tracks myriad possible next activities for the user.
> > ⬞ PotUS: A live-stream interface intended for use with political offices. We run a candidate who agrees that while they are executing their office, there will be a “public agent” present wearing something like [simulavr.com](https://simulavr.com) with the feed from whatever cameras we put on it live-streamed to some group of voluntarily chosen people on the internet, most of it public.
> > :star: Black Market: A violence free, quality-assured, and reasonably priced alternative to the current system. [bmkt.eth](https://bmkt.eth)
> > ★ Yggdrasil: A token-based membership system for the thirteen teams in the 13 13s. Holding certain tokens should permit access to information and the serve as proof of identity characteristics like not being a member of law enforcement. [ygg.army](https://ygg.army)
> > ☆ Danger: A system for collecting reviews of and probabilistically estimating the likelihood that someone will prevail in a physical confrontations. I want to, if necessary, be able to provide to players the option of a real threat of physical force that can be backed up.
> > ⛥ Space: The point of 13 13s is, at its heart, about devising a new system for the determination of control of physical spaces. I want to build a 3D model of the world, and give people control of spaces backed by three independent rules-enforcement groups. I want to do away with the police, but there has to be a real system for addressing someone who has been told by the controller of a space that they are not allowed to be there.
> > ⛧ Muskshacks: A program to combine the work of tens of thousands of artists into thirteen wraps for thirteen Tesla Cybertrucks. It will be SVG images drawn from collections of millions with simple interfaces for decomposition and recoloring.
> > ✮ Hours: I want to distribute thirteen tokens for time spent in service of the 13 13s. There are thirteen basic wants, stuff like food, shelter, sex, drugs… Relying lots on recordings of the time in question: dashcams for couriers, captures of pair programming sessions, etc.
