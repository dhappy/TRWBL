I want to start a church to be the successor to Christianity and Islam.

I also want to run for public office, eventually, ideally, the Presidency.

For the leader of the church to be the primary political leader is the Islamic end-of-days myth called the Caliphate.

The point is in some ways to recognize the existence of the Spirit and the reality of that mode of thought regardless of where it originates. To have a society where that is respected and encouraged is definitely part of the goal, and so the concept of a Caliphate fits in several ways.
