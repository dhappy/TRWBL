<p>There are several ways the system will generate funds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/2gc6e09zgfaqf4bpe2c6l0x">Stuff</a> tracks the location and ownership of any item. It allows for the purchase of items, and though this sale is direct from seller to buyer, an optional percentage will be donated back.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/950aqp7aas21glbho4mlvxj">The Black Market</a> is a portion of <a href="/notes/2gc6e09zgfaqf4bpe2c6l0x">Stuff</a> devoted to the distribution of substances in a violence-adverse privacy-preserving way.</li>
<li>The <a href="/notes/2gc6e09zgfaqf4bpe2c6l0x">Stuff</a> is moving between fixed locations via <a href="/notes/btzu3ymifbepie8aqx16gaq">Duos</a>. Again, payment is direct, but a voluntary percentage is suggested.</li>
<li>When <a href="/notes/25o1thima7xhdngin9ogusd">staying</a>, some locations will have rents.</li>
</ul>
