My revolution tale is somewhat different from yours, but there are parallelsâ€¦

Rather than a military coup, my transition is through the rise of a political party so fundamentally different from the establishment that when their candidate is elected President, it is regarded historically as a revolutionary event.

I've been trying to massage the story to the point it's not me who's elected President because I know describing that part of the story sounds like grandiosity & will turn off the vast majority of listeners.

The question is, "if not me, then who?" If there were a solid candidate, they'd be on the stage already and I am the only one with anything resembling a clear picture of how I hope to accomplish my goals.

I plan to mitigate the problem through a judicious application of radical transparency. The entire execution of the office will be livestreamed with interfaces to allow the public to participate.

The only real sticking point are our covert activities that would be compromised by a livestream. It'd be safe to do if war were somehow ended. My plans of how to accomplish that are still in formation, but developing new information networks to facilitate open conspiracies is a crucial component.

Ultimately, I want to be Dovokin from Zelazny's _Princes In Amber_. In the series the characters possess cards that warp reality in various ways. Toward the end it's revealed there's a gnome in the dungeon who's responsible for creating all these cards and allowing the Princes to be the Princes.

I want to be in the room with the President or whoever & it's always someone's in the room with me. You may be President, but I'm the one that brought an end to the bullshit. I'm pivotal in the end of war, homelessness, and hunger; helping to usher in a new post-scarcity age.
