<ul>
<li>
<p>^stay <strong>Stay:</strong> Mapping spaces, capturing task descriptions, and coordinating property management, allowing participants to maintain and reserve spaces at a minimum of monetary cost.
Space is rented by a user under the auspices of a set of teams. The team specifies the expected application of the space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Substances:</strong> An interface for selling things with a digital testing certificate. Aimed in large part at the violence, dilution, &#x26; theft-free distribution of substances, be they pharmacetical or psychotropic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Courier:</strong> Rather than most substances being delivered through the mail, there could be a person-to-person blind delivery service. Couriers are pairs of people in a vehicle. They serve a variety of tasks dependent on the need:</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dashcam:</strong> An Android app for recording driving with an active operator to be called in times of emergency. The same application is used when a pair is called on as camerapeople. One of the main rule enforcement mechanisms is to send camerapeople to investigate disturbances.
The streams are shared with anyone present in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dispatch:</strong> Cars are generally two people and they can serve a variety of functions. As Driver &#x26; <a href="#courier">Courier</a> delivering a parcel. As Driver and <a href="#stuff">Clerk</a> pandering to a rider in the car. The dispatch application helps the pairs coordinate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alignments:</strong> Allow the 13 teams of Yggdrasil to coordinate with each other to allocate the 13 axes. Each teams starts by specifying their optimal layout. This program would also contain other aspects of team coordination such as the various bonding curves for token swapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code:</strong> The 13 teams each spearhead a project. Participants may be members of multiple teams to varying extents. Each team has a development group for each of the 13 projects. (Albeit perhaps of size zero.) These dev groups meet in spaces coordinated by <a href="#stay">Stay</a>. <a href="#code">Code</a> captures livestreamed pair programming sessions encoded with metadata describing tasks, decisions, and bugs. Peers review the process and give kudos and demerits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mïmis:</strong> A stream of JSON-LD documents alter the state of a Neo4j graph. Users navigate the resultant structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reader:</strong> A web-based eReader meant to allow browsing the universal library stored in <a href="#m%C3%AFmis">Mïmis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stuff:</strong> What does the world hold and where is it located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 13-Sign Zodiac / Hijri / 5hr + 5hr light &#x26; dark / 100 minutes per hour / 100 seconds per minute; coordinated with the housing arrangements from <a href="#stay">Stay</a> &#x26; devs from <a href="#code">Code</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ring:</strong> Part of rules enforcement relies on the credible threat of physical force. This is determined by peer-reviewed recordings of fights.</p>
</li>
