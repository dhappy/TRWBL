<blockquote>
<p>Yellow is therapy.</p>
<p>One of the most common is Holotropic Therapy. It involves listening to music so loud you can't hear yourself scream.</p>
<p>The noise isolates you &#x26; can give you private space in the midst of others.</p>
<p>I want to combine it with the ride-share aspect of the Courier system. People hop in a car to both go somewhere, pick something up from the in-car inventory, and listen to music so loud you can't communicate with anyone.</p>
<p>The need to "put on a face" is lessened.</p>
