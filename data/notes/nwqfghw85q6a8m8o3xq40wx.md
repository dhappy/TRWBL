If the system were to break in a major way & I was to be seen making serious inroads into the [[dismantling of Christianity & Islam|philosophy.gaianism]], I would fear for my life.

There are too many people who are too deeply entrenched in their current narratives to realistically expect them to change. Islam in particular has an established track record of violence toward those that threaten it.

My ideal is a cruise ship which provides much of its own food through hydroponics. The [[Stay|13-13s.axes.projects.spaces]] and [[Stuff|13-13s.axes.projects.stuff]] systems which track spaces and things would be active and providing the passengers with the widest selection of options possible.

Upon further reflection what I actually want is the aircraft carried, but come equipped with a full comportment of highly competent soldiers.
