If the system were to break in a major way & I was to be seen making serious inroads into the dismantling of Christianity & Islam, I would fear for my life.

There are too many people who are too deeply entrenched in their current narratives to realistically expect them to change. Islam in particular has an established track record of violence toward those that threaten it.

So, were this to break in a major way and start to have real effects I would take to the seas.

My ideal is a cruise ship which provides much of its own food through hydroponics. The [[Stay]] and [[Stuff]] systems which track spaces and things would be active and providing the passengers with the widest selection of options possible.
