<p>Software is orchestrated through leads meetings which are held in environments designed to cater to any reasonable need. President's Kitchens, brothels, &#x26; pharmacopias will be on hand.</p>
<p>Work is done in terms of sprints aligned with the Hijri which uses lunar months.</p>
<p>A team comes together at a location for a sprint. In the first week they triage existing issues, handle incoming requests, and project two-week goals. For two weeks they work on whatever they've chosen. Then for a week they fix tests and integrate with other teams.</p>
<p>All programming is pair programming.</p>
<p>I've done it with a competent driver and it left me with so much more of my brain for the design.</p>
