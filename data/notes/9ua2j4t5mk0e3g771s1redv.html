<blockquote>
<p>Dangerous people determined by peer rated recordings of fights.</p>
<p>If someone is somewhere the rules say they shouldn't, these are the final line.</p>
<p>When the lights begin to flash silver and red you know Silver is on their way &#x26; if you're still here when they arrive you have to deal with them.</p>
<p>You do so knowing the tricks in their arsenal include you waking up several countries away naked and alone.</p>
<p>These are the children of Eris: the Goddess of Chaos.</p>
<p>I want to help the Ukraine by occupying Russia's borders to the north &#x26; west. Bring in lots of people unwilling to be violent and live-stream every second of their time.</p>
<p>They'll just occupy the spaces and the only way to get them out will be to act unjustly while on the air.</p>
<p>By bring in those spaces though and showing Putin that he can lose territory in other ways, so maybe it's time to rethink Ukraine.</p>
<p>If not, we just get more and more people and slowly, peacefully, take over the country.</p>
