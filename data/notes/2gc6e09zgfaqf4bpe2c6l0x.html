<p>The gameboard, which consists of some set of static locations &#x26; some set of vehicles, has a variety of objects in it many of which are tracked and available to purchase.</p>
<p>Some of the locations &#x26; vehicles will be storing items for sale. The ideal is to make as much of the cost, characteristic, and location data for items as public as possible. Then, anyone interested in problems of the supply chain would have as much real data as possible to work with in coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>Shoppers are able to see collections either by the seller or by what's available at a particular location.</p>
<p>Locations are specified as <a href="/notes/mvlthfbr378c2njz7pjykmx">waypoints</a> to prevent thieves from using the data to target holders. Alternatively, <a href="/notes/5zhr7nv3gs8w8wma3llj2yr">Silver</a> could provide protection and try to guarantee that anyone attacking is identified so that action can be taken to damage their reputation within the game.</p>
<p>Cars can travel in pairs and locations can be guarded. This drives up cost, but the system can handle that planning.</p>
