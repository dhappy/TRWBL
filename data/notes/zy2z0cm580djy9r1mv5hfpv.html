<p>This is an idea for an event facilitation program.</p>
<ol>
<li>An Owner maps a site and designates availability</li>
<li>A Host selects the site and time period they would like to reserve</li>
<li>A Host invites Guests to pick spaces for the duration</li>
<li>Guests make reservations for spaces</li>
<li>Guests specify substances they are interested in</li>
<li>Dealers can see all the users desires and can make bids for a house</li>
<li>Guests view bids and make specific purchasing requests</li>
<li>Some set of bids are accepted</li>
<li>Dealers individually seal each of the orders and mail it to the Collector</li>
<li>The Collector conglomerates all the packages into one parcel</li>
<li>The Bootlegger picks up the parcel, divides the orders into combination locked bags with a printed nfc card in the lock
<ul>
<li>The front of the nfc card is artwork provided by the Guests</li>
<li>The back of the nfc card is a QR code</li>
<li>The value of the nfc card is a url that returns the value of the QR code</li>
<li>There is a pouch on the bag such that the back of the card cannot be viewed without removing the lock</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A piece of paper with the Guests alias is placed in the pouch along with the card</li>
<li>The bags are delivered to the site</li>
<li>The bags are distributed to rooms according to reservations</li>
<li>The Guest receives the bag</li>
<li>The QR code contains a link to get the combination of the locked</li>
<li>They authenticate to the app and confirm receipt</li>
</ol>
