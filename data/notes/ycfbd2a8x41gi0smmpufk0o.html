<p><em>TRWBL</em> operates under the assumption at some point in the future homelessness and hunger will be eliminated for at least a whole day.</p>
<p>It's an attainable goal physically. We have enough shelter and food for everyone to have a share. The real issue would be the logistics. Tracking all the people and tracking where they eat and lodge.</p>
<p>It'd be alot better if it were a program coming not from the establishment. I want to try and sell black people on a plan for non-violent revolution beginning as a "black" club that one only gains membership to by being judged as "black" by the existing membership.</p>
<p>One could have their Black card revoked as social censure. Each team aims to satisfy one of thirteen basic needs. Black people's is drugs. They evolve a market with testing facilities between the production and distribution through blind couriers which doesn't rely on violence to mediate issues.</p>
<p>We aim to create a rat park where everything's available, but the populace is content enough that they don't abuse.</p>
<p>The main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called <a href="/notes/0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u">Yggdrasil</a> of which the Black team is one.</p>

<p>Conceptually, <em>TRWBL</em> is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history much like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.</p>
<p>The desire for historical significance will then be one of the primary drivers for participation, particularly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#synopsis"></a></h2>
<p>An organization funded by the distribution of substances offers a viable alternative to the police in maintenance of a new mechanism for the control of space. Spaces held by the organization make heavy inroads into properties controlled by churches and banks.</p>
<p>The needs of the network of locations is managed through a 3D interface that also tracks what spaces everyone controls through time.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="/notes/5zhr7nv3gs8w8wma3llj2yr">Silver team</a> will need recordings of combatants that are available for rules enforcement.</li>
<li>All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.</li>
<li>One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn &#x26; rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.</li>
<li>Money, in general, should be funneled into <a href="/notes/46nefi7al8pvhetye9vg1v2#^code">Code</a> where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.</li>
