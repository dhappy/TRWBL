<p><em>TRWBL</em> is a near-term science fiction story describing the progression from the world of today to a future without homelessness, hunger, or war.</p>
<p>If such a narrative could be made sufficiently convincing, people might be convinced to participate in the initial steps outlined for bringing the plan to fruition.</p>
<p>The main vehicle for execution is the creation of an augmented reality game called <a href="/notes/0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u">Yggdrasil</a>.</p>

<p>Conceptually, <em>TRWBL</em> is supposed to bootstrap itself by gaining the support of people who see it as feasible, and, in doing so, gain further followers until there is a steadily growing consensus that to take part in the story will be to find a place in history like marching at Selma or against Vietnam.</p>
<p>Thje desire for historical significance will be one of the primary drivers for participation, particualrly given the large percentage of the activities that will be recorded.</p>

<li>All technological aspects of the system should be open-source. In situations where open solutions don't exist yet, rather than developing new work, whenever possible market pressure will be applied to existing corporations to open their technologies.</li>
<li>One of the first fundraisers will be an early prototype of the courier system used to deliver innocuous items such as corn &#x26; rock salt. Ownership within the system is represented as an NFT.</li>
<li>Money, in general, should be funneled into <a href="/notes/46nefi7al8pvhetye9vg1v2#^code">Code</a> where it will be converted into computer programs to support various aspects of the process.</li>
