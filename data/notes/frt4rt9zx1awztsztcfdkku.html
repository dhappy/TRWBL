<p>From MetaGame:</p>

<p>I've not been able to come up with a succinct sales pitch for my ideas to date, but I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>There are 13 teams with 13 characteristics taken one apiece from 13 sets. So, for example, there's a team whose color is Gold, whose segment of society is ‚ÄúThe Establishment‚Äù, meaning specifically the US Government. The rest of the world is another, I think, two teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://dhappy.github.io/13-13s/">https://dhappy.github.io/13-13s/</a></p>
<p>There are 13 Captains. The President would be one. I get to be one. I have one buddy who's been through this with me for years that I told could Captain.</p>
<p>I want Ryan Renolds for Mint Mobile. I want to use mobile cell towers to provide network coverage to war areas and create the logistical support necessary for every combatant to have a live-streaming minder recording everything they do in the conflict.</p>
<p>My assumption is that people won't be capable of the brutality necessary for war if they know that everyone on the planet will have near instant access to the knowledge that they personally did whatever.</p>
<p>The short game is about creating a piece of software to composite 13 completely unique wraps for 13 Cybertrucks modified to support someone living out of it: ‚ÄúMuskshacks‚Äù.</p>
<p>I want to put light bars on the 13 wrapped Cybertrucks.</p>
<p>The deal I want to propose is there's an auction. I get them for the first year then they go to the winner of the auction.</p>
<p>I'll record a video of my fleet of Cybertrucks sealing off the exits from nearby law enforcement establishments. I tell them that if I, or anyone operating under the protection of the Resistance, are arrested, we will seal you in wherever you take us.</p>
<p>Some shots of these things screeching up with that electric acceleration and closing a place off in under 90 seconds would, I think, be impressive.</p>
<p>I'd publish the video to the public and let everyone know that this was the advertised response, so the cops can't complain too heartily that it's been done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want something to fire a pilons into the ground securing the truck in place.</p>
<p>Part of the deep cut for this one is that certain parts of this are kept secret and released in conjunction with the Presidential Inaugurations which happen to align with the beginning of Capricorn on the 13-sign scientifically accurate Zodiac.</p>
<p>So, these trucks, or even better, something disguised as a PoS, would park near residential areas, anchor itself to the ground, and use powerful speakers to create a minor seismic event.</p>
<p>Also, if they're acting as a blockade the pilons could be difficult to force apart from the truck, but very easily detached by an operator. So you roll up &#x26; stick. It'll be difficult to unstick you without your cooperation.</p>
<p>So the cops will just stop arresting people rather than deal with the hassle. What do you think they'd do?</p>
<p>In reality, I hope to use the roll up and stick method for controlling access to a location before it's at the police station. I want to throw parties with lots of sex and quality drugs at the end of a single road with several choke points planned if law enforcement were to show up.</p>
<p>Because I want to live-stream the historical process that is The Revolution. Every day we make some progress and that is shared with anyone interested instantaneously.</p>
<p>So, much of the debauchery would be very public.</p>
<p>But this is when I've got my threat of The Resistance's truck fleet. We'll tell the police that we're not going to do anything hurtful &#x26; they best just leave us alone.</p>
<p>People can have NFC cards that prove that a specific physical chip is being read. So long as you keep control of your card, you can prove you're you.</p>
