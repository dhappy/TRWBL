<p>Each of the <a href="/notes/0kpwtvbizo8p5kwm7ut8z4u">13 teams</a> has a leader responsible for making certain early decisions such as who will populate their team initially.</p>
<p>There are three alliances: red, blue, and purple. Red is made of three teams that <em>must</em> be Captained by XX people, Blue is three XY-led teams, and Purple is seven teams led by anyone.</p>
<p>As the teams grow, most decisions should largely be passed on to voting structures of the entire populace though the captain will retain certain benevolent dictator powers necessary for efficient administration.</p>
