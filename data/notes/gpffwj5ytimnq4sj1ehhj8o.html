<p>[Silver|13-13s.colors.Silver] is in-your-face enforcement. Direct physical confrontation.</p>
<p>The third branch of enforcement is the [Green|13-13s.colors.Green] which is all life. I want to put an ambush of pumas at the behest of rules enforcement. Pumas trained to leave non-violent people alone, but to subdue violent people.</p>
<p>I'd train them by creating markers &#x26; associating the names with the availability of prey.</p>
<p>I'd start out with about 100 rabbits &#x26; a field divided into quadrants. In each quadrant there is a tube that launches a rabbit into the scene. There's a set of five buttons that light up when hit in a color and make a noise.</p>
<p>Some of the combinations will result in rabbits. The pads will be able to speak back through their colors &#x26; I want to give voice to the land to the ambush. They hit the “rabbit” &#x26; the pad responds with the sound / color combination that represents “there's something wrong with the landscape”. There's some sort of signalling. I want to take a LLM &#x26; plug an ambush into one end &#x26; English the other.</p>
<p>I want to talk to teach large cats to express themselves using combination sound &#x26; color pads trained by a LLM.</p>
<p>Near a city we will put five stations &#x26; in each there are five color-changing pads. The pads have different functions according to the whims of the AI.</p>
<p>I think we might simply collar everyone &#x26; accept they're part of <a href="/">The Game</a> now.</p>
