<p>My goal is to come up with an alternate system for the control of space &#x26; distribution of goods, &#x26; make them so that a percentage of the funds traveling through the system go into increasing the amount of space under the control of the system.</p>
<p>For my propaganda I want Tik-Tok length pieces showing people interacting with fictional pieces of software.</p>
<p>I just discovered <a href="https://globe.gl">Globe.gl</a> which lets me easily draw paths on a 3D globe. The interaction I want to show is a person &#x26; AI collaborating to plan the traveler's living situation for the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Part of what you see on the screen is a tree of potential destinations with indications of the likely quality of housing that'll be available at each location. They can adjust their rank of where they'd like to go &#x26; how long they'd like to stay there so the AI can present them with an optimumish travel plan.</p>
<p>A major difference though is nobody has a permanent address. I think I want to have the system temporarily deed the held land to the owner du jour. Whatever it takes to give the holder the maximum protection under the law.</p>
