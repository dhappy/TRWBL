<h1 id="spaces">Spaces<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#spaces"></a></h1>
<p>The game is about changing the rules about how space is allocated such that no one has to sleep outside and on average a much higher percentage of people are very satisfied by their housing accommodations.</p>
<p>The land comes from several sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>established ecovillages</li>
<li>converted churches</li>
<li>converted banks</li>
<li>purchased plots</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a space is entered into the system, it can be held by a player.</p>
<p>A hold may be in the future. Holds are subject to revision up to half a lunar cycle before they're to be executed. At that point they are fixed and the holder can make concrete plans for their stay.</p>
<p>Stays are for relatively short periods — less than a lunar month — and players are constantly moving around the board.</p>
<p>The system knows which amenities and tools the user prefers and works to make sure they're either readily or shortly available.</p>
