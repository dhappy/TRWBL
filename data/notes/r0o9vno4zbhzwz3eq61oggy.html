<p>The game is ultimately about the allocation and control of physical space.</p>
<p>There will be a 3D model of the available spaces that helps the participants to know what spaces they control &#x26; what the rules are for others.</p>
<p>All spaces are equipped with video monitoring though the controller of the space can request to disable it. In-game conflict is frequently handled in part by recording the offending parties.</p>
