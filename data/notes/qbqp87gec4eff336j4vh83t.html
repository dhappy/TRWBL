<p>Gaianism is designed to be the successor to Christianity and Islam. It respects the existence of the Holy Spirit as a mode of thought, but doesn't believe that it is caused by an omniscient being.</p>
<p>So, the structure of the church is much like existing ones, just the belief in the origin of the motivating experience is different.</p>
<p>So far as deity, “God” is all life at any point in time. Every organism is a part of the Godhead, and more complex composite aspects are formed by interactions between organisms.</p>
<h2 id="the-fall-of-christianity">The Fall of Christianity<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-fall-of-christianity"></a></h2>
<p>The primary tool to dismantle Christianity is to press on the concept of the virgin birth. To ask believers if they genuinely believe a virgin got pregnant, and then how they know that their experience of the Spirit originates outside their head.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the Christians we are looking to convert are relying on Social Proof to determine their beliefs. They look to their family and community to evaluate their structures. If an influential portion of the population <em>(some of whom could be existing atheists)</em> supports the position, it could shift things like a tide.</p>

<p>I also want to run for public office, eventually, ideally, the Presidency.</p>
<p>For the leader of the church to be the primary political leader is the Islamic end-of-days myth called the Caliphate.</p>
<p>The point is to recognize the existence of the Spirit and respect the reality of that mode of thought. To have a society where that is respected and encouraged is definitely part of the goal, and so the concept of a Caliphate fits in several ways.</p>
