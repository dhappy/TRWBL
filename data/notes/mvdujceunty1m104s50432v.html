<blockquote>
<p>You're in charge of Silver, i.e. Rules Enforcement.</p>
<p>In general there are almost no universal rules. One of the core concepts though is control of space — particularly having the capacity to make anyone leave the space at your behest.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics we want is genuine dangerousness. Participants will fight each other, the bout is recorded, and the game as a whole votes as to who the more dangerous is in a matchup.</p>
<p>It should be possible to select enough genuine capacity to subdue &#x26; immobilize that Silver develops a reputation and one knows that if they escalate the issue to the last two teams — 12 (Silver), &#x26; 13 (Gold), — then they better be prepared to be beat down, tied up, and carted away.</p>
<p>The trickiest issue is guns. My current inclination is to have them, but have them loaded for self-defense rather than murder. When loading for self-defense, you start with non-lethal <em>(probably)</em> rounds: two birdshot, one buckshot, another bird, the rest bucks.</p>
