<p>From MetaGame:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In West Africa the primary mode of transport is "bush taxi". At spots in the city there's "garages" for adjoining cities. Travelers arrive &#x26; seats are sold in a car (8 in a regular sedan) for travel to the appropriate city.</p>
<p>Whenever a carful of people pay their fares, the car departs.</p>
<p> Banjul Breweries in The Gambia would, on rare occasions, donate two standing coolers full of Julbrew to the local Peace Corps Volunteers. When I found out one of these parties was happening, I did ~700km in ~48 hours: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nouakchott,+Mauritania/Banjul,+The+Gambia/">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Nouakchott,+Mauritania/Banjul,+The+Gambia/</a> Unfortunately, I didn't really sleep on the way down &#x26; fell asleep shortly after getting hammered. :joy_cat:</p>
<p>My biggest issue currently is my mother. I have a wide and varied life experience that includes several extended periods of florid psychosis &#x26; mania where I was convinced not only that social change is possible, but that it was eminent and I was going to play a significant role.</p>
<p>I believed I was fated to be a significant historical figure on par with the magnitude of Jesus and Mohammed. The basic mechanism was a short term fictional autobiography which outlined the historical period where humanity graduated to a post-scarcity society and the specters of hunger, homelessness, &#x26; war were vanquished.</p>
<p>I was going to be remembered for longer and more widely Jesus because of this story which was going to lay out the major processes by which WAGMI.</p>
<p>Also because there were three major vectors of change: political, religious, &#x26; economic. The religious component included the widespread disillusion of Yahweh-centered faiths. Christianity is grounded heavily in social proof - that right behavior is best determined by looking what your communities are doing. Good people go to church &#x26; believe, so to be good you be Christian.</p>
<p>That sort of holding mechanism should be vulnerable to shifting the believers opinion as to how popular the position is within their communities. Convince a few high profile people to start to sway the fringes and that spreads to more until a critical mass is reached &#x26; it tips to where the consensus opinion isn't that Yahweh exists.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be as much about refuting Yahweh as offering an alternative theology where being lead by the Spirit is a real and meaningful cognitive mode, but it doesn't originate outside of the believers mind. The primary activity of the church is to infiltrate and subvert churches to take them over and convert the land they hold to electronically managed communal space.</p>
<p>I want to take the churchs' land &#x26; the banks. Between those two we'd have like 15% of the total in my part of the world.</p>
<p>So followers of Gaianism would strive to live in the Spirit, but because there's no omniscient being causing the experience, there's no being setting rules either.</p>
<p>The morality of actions can be judged simply on their own merits. So, specifically, this means many Gaians have very large numbers of sex and drug-fueled experiences.
It was because of this part of the plan that I started wanting to find ways to slow the burn. If I were genuinely to start making serious inroads into dismantling Islam, there is a very high probability someone will murder me.</p>
<p>During this period, the story warped into an extended slow but hard break.</p>
<p>I wanted to build the church on a sort of health-conscious hedonism in secret, but capturing tens of thousands of hours of footage. On the election of a US President somehow enmeshed in the scheme, all the footage is released. Some percentage of the population learns there's been a massive conspiracy that's been evolving around them for the last several years.</p>
<p>I'd like to have an AI tailor selections from the accumulated footage targeted to each person receiving a rude awakening...</p>
<p>Growth is in terms of powers of 13, so there are 13 Captains. In the first expansion, each of those 13 Captains recruits 13 people, so 13¬≤ are added, for 182 people. The second expansion is 13¬≤ places going to the Captains to largely be distributed amongst the existing members. The growth is:</p>
<p><code>Expansion  |  # Added  |  Total</code>
<code>-----------+-----------+-------</code>
<code> 0         | 13        | 13</code>
<code> 1         | 13 * 13   | 13 + 13¬≤ = 182</code>
<code> 2         | 13 * 13¬≤  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ = 2,379</code>
<code> 3         | 13 * 13¬≥  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ = 30,940</code>
<code> 3         | 13 * 13‚Å¥  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ + 13‚Åµ = 402,233</code>
<code> 4         | 13 * 13‚Åµ  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ + 13‚Åµ + 13‚Å∂ = 5,229,042</code>
<code> 5         | 13 * 13‚Å∂  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ + 13‚Åµ + 13‚Å∂ + 13‚Å∑ = 67,977,559</code>
<code> 6         | 13 * 13‚Å∑  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ + 13‚Åµ + 13‚Å∂ + 13‚Å∑ + 13‚Å∏ = 883,708,280</code>
<code> 7         | 13 * 13‚Å∏  | 13 + 13¬≤ + 13¬≥ + 13‚Å¥ + 13‚Åµ + 13‚Å∂ + 13‚Å∑ + 13‚Å∏ + 13‚Åπ = 11,488,207,653</code></p>
<p>Since the timeline is grounded in the election of a radically different US President, there would be four expansions for five million coconspirators before election day. Between election day &#x26; the Inauguration there'd be the fifth expansion to bring us to ~68 million to prepare to release the footage to the world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the story shifted again to it's highly unlikely I could control the virality of the existence of this scheme and my involvement, so more than likely a couple hundred million people learn the overarching concept in a spread I don't control. Enough people that I'm no longer convinced that there's not going to be a zealot gunning for me.</p>
<p>If that situation arises, I'll simply take to the seas and control who has opportunity to assassinate me. I was initially thinking an aircraft carrier, but research taught me cruise ships are larger &#x26; have many more floors. So, I model a cruise ship &#x26; the passengers in a computer and try to track the multitude of opportunities available at each juncture a Player is free to pursue something new. Bearing in mind that safe drugs and sex factor heavily into these machinations.</p>
<p>Anywho, one of the hallmarks of my crazy periods was lots of travel. My mom's convinced that if I travel again I'm going to go off the rails &#x26; end up hospitalized or in jail in some foreign place.</p>
<p>Even were I to convince her, I've got a drug abuse regiment that could well make things difficult...</p>
<p>Starting Monday morning, for probably the last year, I've taken ~100mg of Vyvanse &#x26; plowed through ~55 hours of awakedness. Then I'll go down for maybe six, followed by ~18 hours up, then I go down hard on Thursday &#x26; sleep perhaps 20 hours a day through to Saturday. I piddle around for a day or so &#x26; do it all over again the next week.</p>
<p>How I'd fit that to MetaFest would be no problem. I can shift my on days around. I even think the road tripping would be ok so long as I could pass out for a could days without it being an issue.</p>
<p>I've been watching knot tying videos on YouTube &#x26; they've started sending me tarp camping videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/93Db-QURjvU">https://youtu.be/93Db-QURjvU</a></p>
<p>Apparently the best way to do it is using a hammock &#x26; I happen to have one I've never taken out of its sack. I've got paracord, so all I need is the tarp. The one that looked the best in that video was the Warbonnet Superfly. A custom camo 13' one of those is $220.</p>
