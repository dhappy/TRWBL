<p>I want to start a church to be the successor to Christianity and Islam.</p>
<p>I also want to run for public office, eventually, ideally, the Presidency.</p>
<p>For the leader of the church to be the primary political leader is the Islamic end-of-days myth called the Caliphate.</p>
<p>The point is in some ways to recognize the existence of the Spirit and the reality of that mode of thought regardless of where it originates. To have a society where that is respected and encouraged is definitely part of the goal, and so the concept of a Caliphate fits in several ways.</p>
