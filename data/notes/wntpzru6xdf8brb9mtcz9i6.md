> The ultimate government I hope to achieve is a theocracy where a scientific post-Yahweh Christianity controls a huge portion of the space and shares its use between 13 teams:
>
> * Security: who you call instead of the police
> * Surveillance: get a livestreaming cameraperson on the scene
> * Therapy: experience life from unusual contexts
> * Substances: things to do and assorted paraphernalia
> * Sex: human touch and the occasional orgasm
> * Shelter: a place to sleep and store belongings
> * Tools: the things that are used to make things
> * Transport: moving products around and storing them
> * Housekeeping: facilities maintenance
> * Foodstuffs: sustenance
> * Transparency: keeping the process open
> * Timekeeping: adjudicating space transitions
> * Guides: help navigating the world
