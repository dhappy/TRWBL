<p>There are only three hard-and-fast rules in the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>No violence.</li>
<li>No theivery.</li>
<li>Be kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Violence is interpreted broadly to be in line with the Non-Aggression Principle <em>(NAP)</em> of anarchism.</p>
<p>For example, doing something that is likely to damage the water table is interpreted as violence. It isn't limited to simply physical interactions between players.</p>
