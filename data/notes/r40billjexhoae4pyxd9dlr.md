The 13 months of the scientifically accurate Zodiac are used to delineate a social calendar:

* ♑: Capricorn: <1/21 – 2/16>: 27 days
* ♒: Aquarius: <2/17 – 3/11>: 24 days
* ♓: Pisces: <3/12 – 4/18>: 38 days
* ♈: Aries: <4/19 – 5/13>: 25 days
* ♉: Taurus: <5/14 – 6/21>: 40 days
* ♊: Gemini: <6/22 – 7/20>: 30 days
* ♋: Cancer: <7/21 – 8/10>: 22 days
* ♌: Leo: <8/11 – 9/16>: 38 days
* ♍: Virgo: <9/17 – 10/30>: 45 days
* ♎: Libra: <10/31 – 11/23>: 24 days
* ♏: Scorpio: <11/24 – 11/29>: 6 days
* ⛎: Ophiuchus: <11/30 – 12/27>: 28 days
* ♐: Sagittarius: <12/28 – 1/20>: 25 days

The 13-sign zodiac is the scientifically accurate representation of the position of the constellations relative to the plane of the elliptic.

The calendar is zero-indexed with 100 minute hours and hundred second minutes. Initially, it is counting down to -1/♐/0 ≣ 0⁄♑⁄0 which falls on January 20ᵗʰ, in the year of the Inauguration of a President of the U.S.A..

The 0ᵗʰ year is the start of the Revolution. In one possible future, Joe Biden learns of this plan and decides to participate, making year zero the beginning of his tenure *(2021)*. In another he is defeated by a candidate supporting the revolution, making the year zero 2025. In another it isn't until 2029.

In any case, the transfer of power to the revolutionary structure follows the established mechanism for doing so: an election.
